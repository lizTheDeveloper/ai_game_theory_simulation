# Diplomatic AI Test - COMPLETE

**Test Started:** October 8, 2025 (10:14 PM)  
**Test Completed:** October 8, 2025 (10:21 PM)  
**Log:** `logs/mc_diplomatic_ai_test_20251008_221434.log`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (10/10 runs)

## What We're Testing

**Research-based diplomatic AI system with dual-use modeling:**
- Benefits: Strategic reasoning, information integrity, communication bridging
- Risks: Manipulation, dependency capture, mission creep, biased mediation

## Observations So Far

### ‚úÖ Diplomatic AI Deployment Confirmed!
```
ü§ù DIPLOMATIC AI PROTOCOL DEPLOYED (Month 40)
```

**This is huge!** The system reached the deployment threshold:
- Strategic reasoning >= 2.0
- Communication >= 1.5
- Alignment >= 0.7
- Democratic governance

This means AI agents are developing the social and cognitive capabilities needed for diplomacy!

### Outcomes (4/10 complete)
- **Dystopia:** 4/4 (100%)
  - 3x "Permanent surveillance state"
  - 1x "High-control society"
- **Extinction:** 0/4 (0%)
- **Utopia:** 0/4 (0%)

### Notable Patterns

1. **Breakthrough Tech Working:**
   - Clean Energy Systems (Month 32)
   - AI-Enhanced Community Platforms (Month 43)
   - Advanced Recycling (Month 45)
   - Sustainable Agriculture (Month 45)
   - Carbon Capture (Month 63)
   - AI-Driven Disease Elimination deployed

2. **Crisis Cascades Still Dominant:**
   - 5-6 crises active by Month 34-40
   - 2.5x-3.0x degradation amplification
   - Golden Ages ending early (21 months, 5 months)

3. **Control Loss Active:**
   - Triggered at Month 37 (70% misalignment risk)
   - Leading to surveillance state dystopias

4. **Long Runs:**
   - Runs lasting 60+ months (longer than before)
   - More breakthrough tech deploying
   - Suggesting systems are more stable?

### What's Missing So Far

**No diplomatic intervention attempts logged yet!**

Possible reasons:
1. Geopolitical crises not triggering (need 2+ simultaneous systemic crises)
2. Interventions happening but failing silently
3. Diplomatic AI deployed too late (Month 40, after crises)
4. Trust too low to attempt intervention

### Key Questions

1. **Will we see any intervention attempts?**
   - Need: foodCrisis OR resourceShortage OR socialCollapse OR economicCrisis (2+ simultaneous)
   
2. **Will interventions succeed if attempted?**
   - Success probability: 40% base for resource conflicts
   - Modified by: capability, trust, alignment
   
3. **Will any risk events trigger?**
   - Biased mediation detection
   - Mission creep attempts
   - Dependency capture warnings

4. **Will nuclear war frequency change?**
   - Previous: 100% of extinctions (5/5)
   - Expected: Lower if interventions work

## Differences vs Previous Run

**Previous (mc_upward_spirals_test):**
- Utopia: 0%
- Dystopia: 50%
- Extinction: 50% (all nuclear war)
- Duration: ~47 months average

**Current (4/10 so far):**
- Utopia: 0%
- Dystopia: 100% (of completed runs)
- Extinction: 0% (so far!)
- Duration: 60+ months (longer runs)

**Hypothesis:** Breakthrough tech + conflict resolution systems may be preventing rapid extinction, but dystopia still dominates due to control loss + surveillance.

## Wait For

- Final outcome distribution (need 6 more runs)
- Any diplomatic intervention attempts
- Risk event triggers
- Nuclear war frequency in extinction runs
- Dependency capture warnings
- Mission creep attempts

---

## FINAL RESULTS

### Outcome Distribution
```
Utopia:      0 / 10 (0.0%)
Dystopia:    6 / 10 (60.0%)
Extinction:  4 / 10 (40.0%)
```

**Extinction Breakdown:**
- All 4 extinctions: `nuclear_war` (100%)

**Dystopia Breakdown:**
- 5x "Permanent surveillance state"
- 1x "High-control society"

### ‚úÖ Diplomatic AI Deployment: 100% Success!

**Deployed in ALL 10 runs:**
- Run 1: Month 40
- Run 2: Month 39
- Run 3: Month 39
- Run 4: Month 31
- Run 5: Month 31
- Run 6: Month 72 (late!)
- Run 7: Month 33
- Run 8: Month 41
- Run 9: Month 37
- Run 10: Month 32

**Average Deployment Month:** 39.5

**Deployment Requirements Met:**
- Strategic reasoning >= 2.0 ‚úÖ
- Communication >= 1.5 ‚úÖ
- Alignment >= 0.7 ‚úÖ
- Democratic government ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå Diplomatic Interventions: 0 Attempts

**No interventions attempted in any run!**

**Why?**
1. **Geopolitical crisis prerequisite not met:**
   - Requires 2+ simultaneous systemic crises (food, resource, social, economic)
   - These crises may not have converged in time
   
2. **Nuclear war triggers too early:**
   - Diplomatic AI deployed Month ~40
   - Nuclear wars occurred in runs 5, 7, 9, 10
   - Timing mismatch: crises trigger before AI is ready
   
3. **Dystopia lock-in:**
   - 6 runs ended in dystopia (surveillance state)
   - Surveillance dystopia may prevent diplomatic AI from being used

### Crisis Cascade Data

**Total crisis events per run:**
- Run 1: 14 events (14 crises, 0 cascading)
- Run 2: 33 events (13 crises, 20 cascading)
- Run 3: 14 events (7 crises, 7 cascading)
- Run 4: 105 events (78 crises, 27 cascading)
- Run 5: 399 events (354 crises, 45 cascading) ‚Üê Extinction
- Run 6: 51 events (10 crises, 41 cascading)
- Run 7: 301 events (267 crises, 34 cascading) ‚Üê Extinction
- Run 8: 43 events (16 crises, 27 cascading)
- Run 9: 491 events (426 crises, 65 cascading) ‚Üê Extinction
- Run 10: 320 events (281 crises, 39 cascading) ‚Üê Extinction

**Pattern:** High crisis counts correlate with extinction outcomes!

### Comparison to Previous Runs

**Previous (mc_upward_spirals_test):**
- Utopia: 0%
- Dystopia: 50%
- Extinction: 50% (all nuclear war)

**Current (with diplomatic AI):**
- Utopia: 0%
- Dystopia: 60% (+10%)
- Extinction: 40% (-10%)

**Slight improvement in extinction rate, but not dramatic.**

## Analysis

### What Worked

1. **Deployment System:** 100% deployment rate shows the capability/alignment thresholds are well-calibrated
2. **Integration:** System integrated cleanly with catastrophic scenarios
3. **No Crashes:** System ran stably for 10 runs

### What Didn't Work

1. **No Interventions:** Geopolitical crisis prerequisite too strict or too late
2. **Nuclear War Still Dominant:** 100% of extinctions still nuclear war
3. **No Utopia:** Upward spirals not activating (need investigation)

### Root Causes

**Why No Interventions?**

Hypothesis 1: **Timing Mismatch**
- Diplomatic AI deploys Month 30-40
- Nuclear war crises happen Month 20-50 (variable)
- If crises happen early (Month 20-30), AI not ready
- If crises happen late (Month 50+), dystopia already locked in

Hypothesis 2: **Prerequisite Too Strict**
- Requires 2+ simultaneous systemic crises
- Food crisis: `foodSecurity < 60%`
- Resource crisis: active
- Social collapse: `socialUnrest + institutionalFailure`
- Economic crisis: `Stage 2+ && unemployment >70% && trust <30%`
- These may not all converge at the same time

Hypothesis 3: **Surveillance Dystopia Prevents Use**
- 60% of runs ended in surveillance state
- Authoritarian governments may disable diplomatic AI
- Or, surveillance state happens before diplomatic AI can help

### Recommendations

1. **Lower Intervention Threshold:**
   - Change from "2+ simultaneous" to "1+ systemic crisis + geopolitical tension"
   - Add: `internationalTension` metric
   
2. **Earlier Deployment:**
   - Lower capability requirements (2.0 ‚Üí 1.5)
   - Allow deployment in Stage 2 (crisis state)
   
3. **Add Escalation Ladder:**
   - Step 1: Tension rising (50% intervention success)
   - Step 2: Crisis imminent (40% success)
   - Step 3: War declared (25% success, last chance)
   
4. **Track Why No Interventions:**
   - Log: "Geopolitical crisis check: 1/2 crises (need 2)"
   - This will show us what's missing

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Wiki Updated:** Diplomatic AI system fully documented
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Investigate Upward Spirals:** Why 0% Utopia?
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Adjust Intervention Triggers:** Make them more likely
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Add Escalation Mechanics:** Multi-step war prevention
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è **International Tension Metric:** Track war likelihood
