# Session Summary: Cascading Failure Implementation

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Focus:** Review degradation mechanics & add cascading failure amplification

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Comprehensive Degradation Mechanics Audit âœ…

**Created:** `degradation-mechanics-audit-oct-9-2025.md`

**Key Findings:**
- âœ… ALL degradation mechanics are fully implemented!
- âœ… 10 distinct crises across 3 systems (environmental, social, technological)
- âœ… Each crisis has immediate shock + ongoing monthly degradation
- âœ… All 17 QoL dimensions are covered by at least one crisis

**Coverage Analysis:**
- Environmental: 4 crises â†’ 9 QoL impacts
- Social: 3 crises â†’ 9 QoL impacts
- Technological: 3 crises â†’ 5 QoL impacts

**Only Gap:** No cascading failure amplification when multiple crises active

### 2. Implemented Cascading Failure Mechanics âœ…

**Problem:** Crises were independent - didn't amplify each other
**Solution:** Added multiplier system that scales with total active crises

**Mechanics:**
```
activeCrises â‰¤ 2: 1.0x degradation (baseline)
activeCrises = 3: 1.5x degradation 
activeCrises = 4: 2.0x degradation
activeCrises = 5: 2.5x degradation
activeCrises â‰¥ 6: 3.0x+ degradation (catastrophic)
```

**Implementation:**
- Added `calculateCascadingFailureMultiplier()` to all 3 crisis modules
- Applied multiplier to ALL ongoing monthly degradation
- Added warning log when multiplier exceeds 1.5x

**Example Scenarios:**
- Climate + ecosystem collapse: 1.0x (only 2, no amplification)
- Climate + ecosystem + meaning collapse: 1.5x (systemic stress)
- Climate + ecosystem + meaning + institutional failure + control loss: 2.5x (cascading collapse)

### 3. Updated Planning Documents âœ…

**Updated:** `plans/remaining_tasks_5_pm_10_08_25.md`

- Marked Phases 1-5 of Golden Age & Accumulation systems as COMPLETE
- Added current session progress summary
- Updated implementation checklist with completion status
- Noted latest Monte Carlo results (60% Dystopia, 40% Extinction, 0% Utopia)

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `src/simulation/environmental.ts`
   - Added cascading failure multiplier to ongoing impacts
   - Added warning log for severe cascading failures
   - Function: `calculateCascadingFailureMultiplier(state)`

2. `src/simulation/socialCohesion.ts`
   - Added cascading failure multiplier to ongoing impacts
   - Function: `calculateCascadingFailureMultiplier(state)`

3. `src/simulation/technologicalRisk.ts`
   - Added cascading failure multiplier to ongoing impacts
   - Function: `calculateCascadingFailureMultiplier(state)`

### Code Pattern:
```typescript
// Calculate cascading failure multiplier
const cascadeMultiplier = calculateCascadingFailureMultiplier(state);

// Apply to ongoing degradation
qol.someMetric = Math.max(0, qol.someMetric - baseRate * cascadeMultiplier);
```

## Expected Impact on Simulation

### Predicted Changes:
1. **Faster collapse spirals** when multiple crises trigger
2. **More realistic catastrophic scenarios** (crises compound)
3. **Harder recovery** from crisis states (accelerating degradation)
4. **More dramatic QoL drops** in multi-crisis situations

### Outcome Distribution Predictions:
- Dystopia may decrease (faster collapse to extinction)
- Extinction may increase (cascading failures accelerate)
- Utopia still at 0% (sustainability checks still stringent)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session):
- [x] Review existing degradation mechanics
- [x] Add cascading failure amplification
- [ ] Run Monte Carlo simulation to test
- [ ] Review results and compare to baseline

### Follow-up:
- [ ] Document cascading failures in wiki
- [ ] Investigate why environmental crises aren't triggering in 120 months
- [ ] Consider adding crisis recovery mechanics (if needed)
- [ ] Tune amplification multiplier based on results

## Research Notes

### Cascading Failure Examples (Real World):
- 2008 Financial Crisis: Housing â†’ banks â†’ credit â†’ unemployment â†’ social unrest
- COVID-19: Health â†’ economy â†’ mental health â†’ social cohesion
- Climate Change: Drought â†’ food â†’ migration â†’ conflict â†’ governance failure

### Design Philosophy:
- Crises should NOT be independent silos
- Real collapse is systemic - failures amplify each other
- 50% amplification per additional crisis is conservative but realistic
- Should create "tipping point" dynamics where 3+ crises becomes unstoppable

### Validation Questions:
1. Do we see cascading failure warnings in logs?
2. Does QoL degrade faster with multiple crises?
3. Does extinction happen sooner in multi-crisis runs?
4. Is 50% amplification too much/too little?

## Conclusion

Successfully added missing cascading failure mechanics to the crisis systems. All degradation pathways are now complete and interconnected. The simulation should now exhibit more realistic systemic collapse dynamics where multiple simultaneous crises create accelerating degradation spirals.
