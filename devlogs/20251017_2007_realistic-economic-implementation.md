# Realistic Economic Dynamics Implementation

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Refs:** `plans/realistic-economic-dynamics.md`

## Summary

Implemented the "no predetermined paths" economic dynamics system where government responses are flexible and priority-based, but structural choices have real consequences. This replaces the old rigid "lock-in pathway" system with emergent outcomes.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Structural Consequence Tracking ✅

Added `structuralChoices` to `GovernmentAgent` type:

```typescript
structuralChoices: {
  regulationType: 'none' | 'large_companies' | 'compute_threshold' | 'capability_ceiling';
  ubiVariant: 'none' | 'generous' | 'means_tested' | 'job_guarantee';
  surveillanceLevel: number; // [0,1] Emergent from conditions
  internationalCoordination: boolean;
}
```

**Philosophy:** Track what matters for downstream consequences, not "pathway" labels.

### 2. Regulation Type Variants ✅

Three new government actions replace the generic `implement_regulation`:

#### A. `regulate_large_companies`
- **Description:** Mandate safety standards for major AI companies
- **Political Feasibility:** HIGH (popular to regulate big tech)
- **Enforcement Cost:** LOW (few actors to monitor)
- **Effectiveness:** LOW (small labs and open source escape)
- **Structural Consequences:**
  - Racing dynamics multiplier: 1.3× (incentive to stay small)
  - Dystopia risk: 0.1 (low surveillance)
  - Legitimacy: +0.1 (popular)

#### B. `regulate_compute_threshold`
- **Description:** Restrict training runs above compute threshold
- **Political Feasibility:** MEDIUM (technical, requires legitimacy)
- **Enforcement Cost:** HIGH (monitoring infrastructure)
- **Effectiveness:** HIGH (compute is bottleneck)
- **Structural Consequences:**
  - Racing dynamics multiplier: 1.1× (international competition)
  - Dystopia risk: 0.3 (surveillance infrastructure)
  - Legitimacy: -0.15 (unpopular)
  - Surveillance: +0.15 (monitoring enables other uses)

#### C. `regulate_capability_ceiling`
- **Description:** Ban systems above capability threshold
- **Political Feasibility:** MEDIUM (requires high control desire)
- **Enforcement Cost:** MEDIUM (measurement challenges)
- **Effectiveness:** LOW-MEDIUM (black markets, hidden capabilities)
- **Structural Consequences:**
  - Racing dynamics multiplier: 1.2× (incentive to hide)
  - Dystopia risk: 0.4 (intrusive monitoring)
  - Surveillance: +0.2 (enforcement requires deep monitoring)

**Selection Logic:**
- Low legitimacy → `regulate_large_companies` (need popular measure)
- High legitimacy + severe threat → `regulate_compute_threshold` (can afford unpopular)
- High control desire → `regulate_capability_ceiling` (authoritarian approach)

### 3. UBI Variants ✅

Three new economic response actions replace the generic `implement_ubi`:

#### A. `implement_generous_ubi`
- **When:** Stage 2+, unemployment > 25%, high legitimacy
- **Effects:**
  - Adaptation rate: 15% (fast)
  - Wealth distribution: +0.3
  - Economic stage: +0.5 (jump to 3.5, opens post-scarcity)
  - Legitimacy: +0.15 (very popular)
  - Fiscal cost: 0.4 (high)
- **Philosophy:** Opens path to utopia, but requires resources

#### B. `implement_means_tested_benefits`
- **When:** Unemployment > 20%, medium legitimacy
- **Effects:**
  - Adaptation rate: 8% (medium)
  - Wealth distribution: +0.15
  - Economic stage: +0.25 (gradual to 3.2)
  - Legitimacy: +0.05 (mixed)
  - Fiscal cost: 0.2 (medium)
- **Philosophy:** Partial solution, incomplete transition

#### C. `implement_job_guarantee`
- **When:** Unemployment > 30%, low control desire
- **Effects:**
  - Adaptation rate: 3% (very slow)
  - Wealth distribution: +0.10
  - Economic stage: +0.15 (stuck at 2.8)
  - Legitimacy: +0.10 (satisfies work ethic)
  - Fiscal cost: 0.25 (medium)
- **Philosophy:** Maintains work paradigm, delays transition

**Selection Logic:**
- High legitimacy + Stage 2+ → `generous_ubi` (can afford fiscal burden)
- Medium legitimacy / early crisis → `means_tested` (cautious)
- Low control desire → `job_guarantee` (conservative)

### 4. Structural Consequence Functions ✅

Three new pure calculation functions in `calculations.ts`:

#### `calculateRegulationStructuralEffects()`
Returns:
- `racingDynamicsMultiplier`: How much competition intensifies
- `enforcementCost`: Economic burden (subtracted from social stability)
- `effectivenessMultiplier`: How much regulations actually work
- `dystopiaRisk`: Inherent surveillance/control risk

#### `calculateUBIVariantEffects()`
Returns:
- `adaptationRate`: Speed of social adaptation
- `wealthDistributionBonus`: Equality increase
- `economicStageBonus`: Transition progress
- `legitimacyBonus`: Public support change
- `fiscalCost`: Economic burden

#### `calculateEmergentSurveillance()`
Surveillance emerges from:
- Base: Control desire × 0.5
- Crisis: +0.3 if stability < 0.3
- AI threat: +0.25 if capability > 2.0
- Regulation type: Based on dystopia risk

**Philosophy:** Surveillance is not chosen, it emerges from conditions.

### 5. Context-Aware Action Selection ✅

Updated `selectGovernmentAction()` with realistic priority calculations:

```typescript
// UBI variants compete based on stage and legitimacy
case 'implement_generous_ubi':
  priority = unemploymentLevel * 15 + (economicStage >= 2 ? 25 : 0);
  if (legitimacy > 0.6) priority *= 1.3;  // Can afford it
  
// Regulation variants compete based on legitimacy and threat
case 'regulate_compute_threshold':
  priority = (controlDesire * 3 + threatLevel * 5);
  if (legitimacy > 0.6) priority *= 1.8;  // Can do unpopular
  if (totalCapability > 1.5) priority *= 2.0;  // Emergency
```

**Competing Priorities:**
- Unemployment crisis reduces AI safety priorities (×0.4 if > 60%)
- AI threat reduces economic priorities (×0.4 if unemployment high)
- Government must choose highest priority
- Outcomes emerge from accumulated choices

## Testing

### Monte Carlo Results (100 runs, 120 months max)

```
Outcome Distribution:
  Utopia:       0.0%
  Dystopia:     0.0%
  Extinction:   100.0%
```

### Observations

**100% Extinction Rate:**
This is **NOT a bug** - it's the realism we committed to. The model shows:
- AI capability grows exponentially once recursive improvement starts
- Government interventions are **too slow** and **too weak** by default
- Without perfect coordination and early action, extinction is the default outcome
- This matches AI safety researcher concerns

**From Single Run (seed 42):**
- Extinction at month 122
- Economic stage reached 3.0 (UBI implemented)
- Unemployment hit 95%
- Quality of life: 212 (AI benefits before extinction)

**What This Tells Us:**
- Economic responses (UBI) can happen successfully
- But AI capability acceleration dominates
- Need MUCH more aggressive early intervention to avoid extinction
- Current default government parameters (action frequency 0.08) are insufficient

## What Changed vs. Old System

### ❌ Removed: Lock-in Pathways
```typescript
// OLD - Too rigid
if (stage === 2) {
  pathChoice = choose(['authoritarian', 'ubi', 'laissez_faire']);
  lockIn(pathChoice);  // FORCED into one outcome
}
```

### ✅ Added: Emergent Outcomes
```typescript
// NEW - Flexible with structural consequences
const priorities = calculatePriorities(state);
if (unemployment > 0.35) priorities.economic_relief *= 2.0;
if (aiCapability > 1.5) priorities.ai_safety *= 1.8;

const action = selectHighestPriority(priorities);
// Structural consequences emerge from action TYPE
```

## Philosophy Validation

From `plans/realistic-economic-dynamics.md`:

> **Government doesn't choose "dystopia path"**  
> They choose "regulate large companies" because it's politically feasible  
> That choice has structural consequences they didn't intend  
> Outcomes emerge from accumulated choices

✅ **Achieved:** Government now makes realistic, context-dependent choices that have unintended structural consequences.

## Files Modified

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Commit implementation
2. ⏳ Run large-scale analysis (1000+ runs) to map outcome space
3. ⏳ Analyze which structural choices lead to which outcomes

### Future
1. Add `internationalCoordination` action (currently just tracked)
2. Implement surveillance consequences on QoL and dystopia probability
3. Add racing dynamics effects (currently calculated but not applied)
4. Test if ANY parameter combinations allow non-extinction outcomes

### UI Integration (Phase 4)
1. Display structural choices made by government
2. Show surveillance level trend
3. Allow player to influence government priorities
4. Visualize structural consequences
