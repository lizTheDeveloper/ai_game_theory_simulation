## ðŸ”¬ System Features

### State Tracking
- **Reserves**: [0,1] phosphate rock reserves (starts 1.0 in 2025)
- **Geopolitical Tension**: [0,1] Morocco controls 70%, weaponization risk
- **Price Index**: [0,10] 1.0 = baseline, tracks scarcity pricing
- **Use Efficiency**: [0,1] currently 20%, target 60% with tech
- **Recovery Rate**: [0,1] circular economy strength
- **Pollution Level**: [0,1] eutrophication from excess P

### Crisis Mechanics
1. **Reserve Depletion**: Economic activity drives mining, efficiency reduces need
2. **Peak Phosphorus**: Detected ~2070 (Month 480+), decline phase begins
3. **Geopolitical Tension**: Increases with scarcity (Morocco 70% concentration)
4. **Supply Shocks**: 15% chance/month at high tension
   - Types: Geopolitical weapon, transport crisis, production failure, speculation
   - Effects: 2-5x price spike, 6-18 month duration, immediate food QoL impact
5. **Price Dynamics**: Gradual increase with scarcity, spikes during shocks
6. **Environmental Feedback**: Pollution â†’ eutrophication â†’ biodiversity loss

### Extinction Pathway
- **Trigger**: Reserves < 15% AND recovery < 30% AND food QoL < 20%
- **Mechanism**: Slow collapse over 24 months (famine)
- **Description**: "Phosphate rock reserves depleted. Agricultural collapse. Global famine."

## ðŸ“Š Expected Impact

### Utopia Path
- **Enables**: Ecological Spiral (reduced pollution from eutrophication)
- **Mechanism**: Circular economy closes the loop (food waste â†’ struvite â†’ crops)
- **Timeline**: Full deployment ~100 months (8 years)
- **Result**: Sustainable post-scarcity agriculture

### Dystopia/Extinction Path
- **Mechanism**: Continued inefficiency â†’ reserves depletion â†’ price crisis â†’ famine
- **Timeline**: Critical depletion by Month 300-400 (25-33 years)
- **Result**: Slow civilizational collapse (resource famine)

### Mid-Game Drama
- **Supply Shocks**: Random crises (historical: 2007-2008, 2022-2024)
- **Geopolitical Tension**: Morocco weaponization (historical precedent)
- **Economic Impact**: Food prices spike, social unrest increases

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Design Decisions

### 1. Use Efficiency Focus
Rather than just modeling depletion, we model **inefficiency** (20% â†’ 60%). This:
- Matches research (massive waste throughout system)
- Creates clear solution pathway (circular economy)
- Enables both extinction AND utopia outcomes

### 2. Geopolitical Realism
Morocco 70% concentration creates:
- Historical precedent (China 2007-2008 tariff)
- Mid-game drama (supply shocks)
- Strategic vulnerability (single point of failure)

### 3. Slow Collapse
Unlike nuclear war (instant) or pandemic (months), phosphorus famine is **slow**:
- 24-month extinction timeline
- Gives time for last-ditch interventions
- Models realistic agricultural collapse

### 4. Auto-Deployment
Technologies auto-deploy when profitable:
- Struvite: Deploys when prices > 1.5x (market incentive)
- Soil optimization: Deploys when reserves < 70% (scarcity incentive)
- Efficient crops: Gradual farmer adoption (1%/month)
- Circular systems: Slowest (systemic change 0.8%/month)

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

### Environmental System
- Pollution feedback (eutrophication damages biodiversity)
- Resource reserves coupling
- Climate-agriculture interactions

### Food System
- Direct food QoL impact from price/scarcity
- Agricultural productivity dependency

### Technology System
- Breakthrough tech unlocks
- Deployment levels affect efficiency
- Research investment requirements

### Extinction System
- New pathway: Resource depletion famine
- Slow collapse (24 months)

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps

1. **Monitor test runs** - Check for:
   - Supply shocks triggering correctly
   - Tech unlocks at right timing
   - Extinction pathway activating (if no mitigation)
   - Circular economy enabling Utopia

2. **Adjust parameters** if needed:
   - Depletion rates (currently 0.15-0.6%/month)
   - Supply shock frequency (15% max at high tension)
   - Tech unlock thresholds
   - Efficiency improvement rates

3. **Document in wiki** - Add to:
   - `docs/wiki/systems/phosphorus-system.md`
   - `docs/wiki/mechanics/extinction-pathways.md`
   - `docs/wiki/mechanics/circular-economy.md`

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophical Note

> "Phosphorus is THE bottleneck. We can synthesize nitrogen from air (Haber-Bosch), but phosphorus is **mined, non-renewable, and has no substitute**. Either we close the loop (circular economy) or we face slow famine."

This system models the **hard constraint** that even advanced AI can't solve with clever algorithms - you need **physical resource recovery** and **systemic change** to sustainable agriculture.

If the model shows high extinction rates from phosphorus depletion, that's a **warning about real-world trajectory**, not a bug!
