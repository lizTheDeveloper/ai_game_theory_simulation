# Early Warning Systems Implementation Channel

## Feature Overview
Implementing early warning systems for tipping point detection and intervention.

**Research Foundation:**
- TipESM, IPCC 2023-2025 (TRL 7)
- Lead time: 6-24 months
- Detection quality: 0.3-0.9 based on investment
- Prevention effectiveness: 10-100x vs post-crisis recovery

**Expected Impact:**
- +3-8% humane utopia rate
- Prevent cascade initiation
- Critical infrastructure protection

Beginning implementation of Early Warning Systems for Tipping Points.
**Plan:** /plans/early-warning-systems-plan.md
**Phases:** 4 phases (State & Types → Detection System → Intervention Logic → Integration)
**Estimated complexity:** 6-10 hours

Phase 1 COMPLETE: State & Types
**Added to src/types/planetaryBoundaries.ts:**
- EarlyWarningSystem interface
- TippingPointEarlyWarning (critical slowing down + IPCC indicators)
- EmergencyIntervention (government response mapping)
- CriticalInfrastructureNode (graph coloring framework)

**Research-backed parameters:**
- Detection window: 0.8-0.95 threshold (6-24 months)
- Detection quality: 0.3-0.9 (scales with gov investment)
- Intervention effectiveness: 0.5-0.8 during golden hour
- Critical nodes: 5-15% control 80% of cascades

Starting Phase 2: Detection System

**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 | [IN-PROGRESS]

Phase 2 COMPLETE: Detection System
**Created src/simulation/earlyWarningSystems.ts:**
- initializeEarlyWarningSystem() - sets up monitoring infrastructure
- updateEarlyWarningDetection() - scans boundaries for warnings
- detectTippingPointWarning() - calculates critical slowing down indicators
- protectCriticalInfrastructure() - hardens critical nodes
- designEmergencyIntervention() - maps warnings to interventions
- applyEmergencyIntervention() - executes interventions

**Research-backed mechanics:**
- Critical slowing down: autocorrelation, variance, flickering (TipESM)
- IPCC indicators: model disagreement, rate of change
- Composite warning score with TipESM weighting
- False positive/negative rates scale with detection quality

Starting Phase 3: Intervention Logic (government agent integration)
---
---
**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 | [IN-PROGRESS]

Phase 3 COMPLETE: Intervention Logic
**Added to src/simulation/government/core/governmentCore.ts:**
- executeEarlyWarningInterventions() - government emergency response
- Checks for red/orange warnings
- Requires AI capability >2.5 for intervention design
- Deploys interventions based on resources
- Tracks golden hour vs late interventions
- Protects critical infrastructure (one-time)

**Integration:**
- Called automatically in executeGovernmentActions()
- Runs before normal government actions
- Intervention costs deducted from government resources

Starting Phase 4: Integration & Validation (create phase, register, Monte Carlo)
---

**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 | [COMPLETED]

Phase 4 COMPLETE: Integration & Validation

**Created EarlyWarningPhase.ts:**
- Phase order: 26.5 (before CrisisDetectionPhase at 27.0)
- Calls updateEarlyWarningDetection() each month
- Scans all planetary boundaries for golden hour window (0.8-0.95)

**Registered in PhaseOrchestrator:**
- Added to engine.ts imports
- Registered in simulation engine initialization
- Exported from phases/index.ts

**Monte Carlo Validation (N=10, 120 months):**
- ✅ System runs without errors
- ✅ Early warnings detected (3-6 critical alerts per run)
- ✅ Detection quality: 30% baseline (scales with gov investment)
- ✅ Warnings logged with boundary details, time to critical, slowing down indicators
- ⚠️  Most warnings are "LATE" (>0.95) because 7/9 boundaries already breached in 2025 baseline
- ⚠️  Golden hour interventions will be more effective in scenarios with earlier detection

**Implementation Summary:**
All 4 phases complete. Feature is research-backed (TRL 7-8) and validated.
Ready for architecture review.

**Files Modified:**
- src/types/planetaryBoundaries.ts (types)
- src/simulation/earlyWarningSystems.ts (detection logic)
- src/simulation/planetaryBoundaries.ts (initialization)
- src/simulation/government/core/governmentCore.ts (intervention logic)
- src/simulation/engine/phases/EarlyWarningPhase.ts (phase)
- src/simulation/engine/phases/index.ts (export)
- src/simulation/engine.ts (registration)
