## Integrated Timeline: Realistic Cascade

### **Phase 1: Slow Burn (2025-2030)** - *We are here*
- Biodiversity: 35% → 30%
- Coral bleaching events increasing
- Amazon approaching tipping point
- Arctic ice declining
- Isolated Day Zero events
- **Deaths**: 1-5M/year (regional famines, disasters)
- **Impact**: Growing stress, still manageable

### **Phase 2: Threshold Crossing (2030-2040)**
- Biodiversity: 30% → 20% (crosses critical threshold)
- Amazon tipping point crossed (~2035)
- Arctic ice-free summers regular
- Coral reefs 50-70% dead
- Day Zero events common
- Insect collapse accelerates
- **Deaths**: 10-50M/year (widespread famine, water wars)
- **Impact**: Global crisis, mass migration begins

### **Phase 3: Cascade Phase (2040-2060)**
- Biodiversity: 20% → 10%
- Amazon transitioning to savanna (carbon bomb)
- Coral reefs 90-99% dead
- Insect pollination failure (-30% food production)
- Permafrost major carbon release
- Multiple breadbasket failures
- **Deaths**: 100-500M/year (global famine, ecosystem collapse)
- **Impact**: Civilization-threatening, possible state failures

### **Phase 4: Post-Collapse (2060-2100)**
- Biodiversity: <10%
- Most ecosystems non-functional
- AMOC approaching collapse (~2100)
- Food production severely compromised
- Only resilient/technological societies survive
- **Deaths**: Depends on interventions
- **Impact**: New equilibrium or extinction

## Simulation Calibration Recommendations

### **Critical Changes**:

1. **Slow down biodiversity loss**:
   ```
   OLD: -0.3%/month = -3.6%/year (insane)
   NEW: -0.04%/month = -0.5%/year (realistic)
   ```

2. **Lower collapse threshold**:
   ```
   OLD: 30% (immediate collapse)
   NEW: 20% (point of no return)
   ```

3. **Add time lag between threshold and impacts**:
   ```
   OLD: Threshold → immediate 100M deaths/month
   NEW: Threshold → 24-48 month acceleration → severe impacts
   ```

4. **Make death rates gradual**:
   ```
   Phase 1 (stress): 0.01% population/month (1M/month)
   Phase 2 (crisis): 0.1% population/month (6-8M/month)
   Phase 3 (collapse): 1-2% population/month (60-120M/month)
   Over years, not weeks
   ```

5. **Model specific tipping points**:
   - Amazon dieback (2030-2035 trigger)
   - Coral collapse (2040-2055)
   - Permafrost release (2050-2100)
   - AMOC weakening (2080-2100)
   - Each has its own timeline

### **Why the Current Model Is Too Fast**:

1. **No ecological inertia**: Real ecosystems have buffers
2. **No time lags**: Stress today → collapse in 10 years, not 6 months
3. **Linear degradation**: Reality is exponential but slower
4. **Single threshold**: Multiple systems with different timelines
5. **Immediate death**: Famine takes years to kill 100M, not months

### **What Should Actually Scare Us**:

Not: "Collapse in 8 months"
But: "Cross point of no return by 2035, then unstoppable 30-year decline"

The horror is:
- We might not act until 2030-2035
- By then, Amazon/coral/insects pass tipping points
- Spend 2040-2070 watching slow-motion collapse
- Can't reverse it, even with TIER 2 interventions
- **The window to prevent it is NOW to 2035**

---

## Implementation Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** (next session):
- Recalibrate biodiversity degradation rate (10x slower)
- Lower collapse threshold to 20%
- Add 24-48 month impact delay
- Make death rates gradual (escalation over years)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
- Model specific tipping points (Amazon, coral, etc.)
- Add time lags between stress and collapse
- Regional variation (some places collapse first)

**LOW PRIORITY** (nice to have):
- AMOC, permafrost (2050+ impacts)
- Detailed insect pollination modeling
- Arctic feedback loops

---

## Bottom Line

**Current Simulation**: "Ecosystem collapse April 2026, humanity nearly extinct by 2027"
**Reality**: "Pass point of no return 2030-2035, severe collapse 2040-2070"

**The simulation is showing end-state (2060s) in present-day (2026).**

Fix: Stretch the timeline by 10-30x to match reality.

The good news: We have more time than 8 months.
The bad news: We're still on track for the collapse the simulation shows, just in 2050 instead of 2026.
The urgent news: The window to prevent it is closing (2025-2035).

---

**Status**: Analysis complete, calibration needed
**Next**: Implement slower, more realistic tipping point dynamics
**Goal**: Show realistic timeline so policymakers understand: "Act in 2020s to prevent 2040s-2060s collapse"
