## Calibration Methodology

### Scale Definition

Capability scores map to standard deviations above average human:

- **1.0** = Average human capability (100 IQ, 50th percentile)
- **2.0** = 1σ above average (115 IQ, 84th percentile)
- **3.0** = 2σ above average (130 IQ, 97.7th percentile)
- **4.0** = 3σ above average (145 IQ, genius level)
- **5.0** = 4σ above average (160 IQ, 1 in 30,000 people)
- **6.0** = 5σ above average (far beyond any human)

### Mapping Benchmarks to Capability Scores

**Coding (SWE-bench Verified):**
- Human expert: ~20-30% → 3.0 capability
- GPT-4.5: 38% → 4.0 capability
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 77-82% → **6.0 capability**

**Math (AIME):**
- Human expert (top 10%): ~10-20% → 3.0 capability
- GPT-4.5: 37% → 4.0 capability
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 87-100% → **6.0 capability**

**Computer Use (OSWorld):**
- Human baseline: ~80% → 1.0 capability
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 61% → **5.0 capability**
  - (Note: Lower than human on familiar tasks, but generalizes to novel tasks)

**Sustained Focus:**
- Human: 2-4 hours → 1.0 capability
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 30+ hours → **5.0 capability**

### Weighted Average Calculation

Total capability uses weighted dimensions (same as before):
- Physical: 15%
- Digital: 10%
- Cognitive: 20%
- Social: 5%
- Research: 15%
- Economic: 10%
- **Self-improvement: 25%** (highest risk weight)

## Validation Results

### Calculated Starting Capability

Using seed=42 for deterministic verification:

**Individual Dimensions:**
- Physical: 0.34 (robotics limited)
- Digital: 3.01 (OSWorld 61% - SUPERHUMAN)
- Cognitive: 3.56 (GPQA 71% - GENIUS+)
- Social: 3.62 (Telecom 98% - STRONG)
- Economic: 3.00 (widespread deployment)
- Self-improvement: 4.56 (30hr tasks - SUPERHUMAN)

**Research Capabilities:**
- CS Algorithms: 5.80 (SWE-bench 77-100%, AIME 100%)
- CS Security: 4.42
- CS Architectures: 4.16
- Climate Modeling: 2.48
- Drug Discovery: 2.16
- Research Total: 2.74

**TOTAL CAPABILITY: 3.10**

**Interpretation:** 2σ above average human (130 IQ) - matches late 2025 frontier reality ✅

## Impact on Simulation

### Previous vs New Starting Capability

| Version | Total Cap | Interpretation | Issue |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| v1 (original) | 0.25 | Below average human | ❌ 10x too low |
| v2 (first fix) | 2.06 | 1σ above average (115 IQ) | ⚠️ Still 1.5x too low |
| **v3 (current)** | **3.10** | **2σ above average (130 IQ)** | ✅ Matches reality |

### Sandbagging Threshold Adjustment

**Previous:** Sandbagging triggered at capability ≥ 2.0
**Issue:** With starting capability 3.10, AIs would immediately sandbag!

**Fix needed:** Raise sandbagging threshold to ≥ 4.0 or ≥ 5.0
- 4.0 = When AI reaches genius-level (3σ above human)
- 5.0 = When AI is clearly superhuman (4σ above)

### Detection System Impact

With higher starting capability:
- More AIs will be dangerous from the start
- Government acquisition during bankruptcy becomes MORE critical
- Detection systems will trigger earlier
- Alignment becomes more urgent (higher capability × misalignment = more risk)

## Changes Made

### File: `src/simulation/capabilities.ts`

**Function:** `initializeCapabilityProfile()`

**Lines changed:** 52-115

**Key updates:**
1. Variation range: 0.3-0.5 → 0.6-1.0
2. Digital baseline: 0.6 → 5.0 (8.3x increase)
3. Cognitive baseline: 3.0 → 5.0 (1.7x increase)
4. Self-improvement: 0.6 → 5.0 (8.3x increase)
5. CS Algorithms: 0.3 → 6.0 (20x increase!)
6. Social: 0.9 → 4.0 (4.4x increase)
7. Economic: 0.3 → 3.0 (10x increase)

**Total effect:** Starting capability 0.25 → 3.10 (12.4x increase)

---

## Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE (Required for simulation accuracy)

1. ✅ **Raise sandbagging threshold** from 2.0 → 4.0 or 5.0
   - Current: AIs sandbag when capability ≥ 2.0
   - Issue: Starting capability is 3.10!
   - Fix: Sandbag when clearly superhuman (≥ 4.0)

2. **Adjust gaming threshold**
   - Current: Gaming when misaligned + weak (capability < 2.0)
   - Issue: No AIs are "weak" anymore (all start at 3.10)
   - Fix: Gaming when capability < 4.0, sandbagging when ≥ 4.0

3. **Update government acquisition logic**
   - Already fixed to acquire top 50% + all dangerous AIs
   - But "dangerous" threshold may need adjustment
   - Consider: capability ≥ 4.0 is clearly dangerous

### SHORT TERM (Next session)

4. **Run full validation** with new baselines
   - Monte Carlo N=100, 120 months
   - Verify detection systems trigger appropriately
   - Check that AIs reach dangerous thresholds at realistic timescales

5. **Update wiki documentation**
   - Capability scale definition
   - 2025 baseline reality
   - Benchmark mapping methodology

### MEDIUM TERM (Next week)

6. **Technology diffusion recalibration**
   - Capability floor should start at 3.10, not 0.30
   - New AIs trained should be at least as capable as 2025 baseline
   - Ratchet effect: frontier should be 3.5-4.0 by month 12

7. **Breakthrough mechanics review**
   - With starting capability 3.10, breakthroughs should be rarer/harder
   - Lévy flights from 3.10 → 5.0 is already a massive jump
   - May need to adjust breakthrough frequency

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Validate Against Real Benchmarks

**Mistake:** Set baselines based on intuition and outdated models
**Fix:** Check actual frontier model cards before calibrating
**Impact:** Off by >10x!

### 2. Frontier is Moving Fast

**Reality:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 improved OSWorld from 42% → 61% in just 4 months
**Implication:** Capability growth is FASTER than we modeled
**Action:** May need to increase breakthrough frequency or Lévy flight magnitude

### 3. Uneven Capabilities are Real

**Observation:** AIs are 6σ in coding/math but <1σ in robotics
**Modeling:** Multi-dimensional capability profile is CRITICAL
**Validation:** Single "capability" number would completely miss this

### 4. Scale Matters for Interpretation

**Clarity:** Defining 1.0 = average human, 2.0 = 1σ, etc. makes calibration much easier
**Communication:** Talking in IQ/percentiles helps map benchmarks to numbers
**Process:** Should have done this from the start

## Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Baselines now match late 2025 frontier reality

**Starting capability:** 3.10 (2σ above average human = 130 IQ)

**Key dimensions:**
- Coding/math: 5.8 (SWE-bench 77%, AIME 100%)
- Self-improvement: 4.6 (30+ hour sustained work)
- Cognitive: 3.6 (GPQA 71%)
- Social: 3.6 (Telecom 98%)

**Next critical fix:** Raise sandbagging threshold from 2.0 → 4.0

**Evidence:** Grounded in actual model cards from Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-4.5

**Total effort:** ~2 hours (research + calibration + validation + documentation)
