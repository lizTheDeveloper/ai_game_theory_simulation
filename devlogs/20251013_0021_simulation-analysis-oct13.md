# Monte Carlo Analysis - October 13, 2025
**Focus:** Environmental collapse dynamics, outcome detection, famine integration  
**Runs:** 10 runs √ó 120 months (logging_test baseline ‚Üí realistic_mortality_test comparison)

---

## üìä **Analysis Summary**

### **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

#### **1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Outcome Detection Bug (Priority 1)**
**Problem:** Environmental collapse not classified as "Extinction"

```
Terminal Logs:
- Month 18: TIPPING POINT CASCADE TRIGGERED
- Month 75: Population 0.814B (83% mortality, 6.6B dead)
- 6 crises active, 3.0x degradation multiplier
- Food security: 0.229 (catastrophic)

Monte Carlo Summary:
- Outcome: Status Quo (100%)
- Population: 0.8B avg
- Interpretation: "Normal conditions"

‚ùå 83% mortality + 6 crises + food catastrophe = Status Quo?!
```

**Why This Happens:**
`src/simulation/endGame.ts` likely checks for:
- Nuclear war ‚Üí Extinction ‚úÖ
- AI takeover ‚Üí Extinction ‚úÖ  
- Population = 0 ‚Üí Extinction ‚úÖ
- **Population decline + environmental collapse ‚Üí ??? (missing check)**

**Fix Needed:**
```typescript
// Add to endGame.ts
if (population < startingPopulation * 0.3) return 'extinction'; // 70%+ mortality
if (tippingCascadeActive && monthsSince > 60) return 'extinction'; // 5+ years of cascade
if (foodSecurity < 0.3 && sustainedMonths > 24) return 'extinction'; // 2+ years starvation
```

---

#### **2. üè¢ Organizations Thrive During Apocalypse (Priority 2)**
**Problem:** Orgs accumulate wealth while 83% of humanity dies

```
Month 75:
- Population: 0.814B (83% dead)
- 6 active crises
- Organizations: Still training AIs, accumulating revenue, expanding

Real World:
- Who are the customers when 6.6B people are dead?
- Who works in the data centers?
- Who maintains infrastructure?
```

**Why This Happens:**
Organization revenue/operations likely have minimal crisis penalties.

**Fix Needed:**
```typescript
// Add to organization logic
if (populationDecline > 0.5) {
  revenue *= (1 - populationDecline); // No customers = no revenue
}
if (activeCrises > 4) {
  bankruptcyRisk += 0.2 * activeCrises;
}
```

---

#### **3. üåæ Famine System Not Firing (Priority 3)**
**Problem:** Food security 0.229 but 0 famines triggered

```
Month 75:
- Food Security: 0.229 (catastrophic - 77% food insecure)
- Famines Triggered: 0
- Expected: Regional famines across Africa, Asia, Middle East

Bug Location: src/simulation/qualityOfLife.ts ‚Üí checkRegionalFamineRisk()
```

**Hypothesis:**
- Famine triggers check wrong thresholds
- Or: Regional food security not synced with global
- Or: Famine system disabled/broken

**Fix:** Debug `regionalFamineRisk()` logic, check thresholds.

---

#### **4. üå™Ô∏è Tipping Cascade Timeline (Priority 4 - FIXED Oct 13)**
**OLD Problem:** Month 18 trigger ‚Üí 2% monthly mortality ‚Üí 83% dead by Month 75 (TOO FAST)

**Research:** UNEP - Current 7/9 boundaries = 9M deaths/year = 0.009% monthly (NOT 2%!)

**FIX IMPLEMENTED:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced binary trigger with continuous severity
- ‚úÖ Mortality scales with food, water, climate, biodiversity thresholds  
- ‚úÖ Baseline: 0.009% monthly (matches research)
- ‚úÖ Can reverse with interventions
- ‚úÖ Tech affects state, not hard-coded reductions

**Status:** Testing in `realistic_mortality_test` Monte Carlo run

---

## üî¨ **Logging Test Run (Baseline - Oct 12)**

### **Run Profile:**
- **Runs:** 10 √ó 120 months
- **Outcome:** Status Quo (100%)
- **Avg Population:** 0.8B (83% decline from 8B start)
- **Avg Food Security:** 0.229 (catastrophic)
- **AI Control:** 0.39 (weak)
- **Cascade:** Active in 100% of runs

### **Typical Timeline:**
```
Month 0: Population 8B, 7/9 boundaries breached
Month 18: Tipping point cascade triggered (OLD SYSTEM - 2% monthly mortality)
Month 24-48: Population decline accelerates
Month 60-90: 6 crises active, 3.0x degradation
Month 75: Population 0.814B (6.6B dead)
Month 120: Sim ends, classified as "Status Quo" (BUG)
```

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Cascade Triggers Too Early:** Month 18 (7/9 boundaries ‚Üí 70% risk ‚Üí 10% chance/month)
2. **Mortality Too High:** 2% monthly = 22%/year (vs UNEP 0.1%/year)
3. **No Recovery Possible:** Irreversible even with interventions
4. **Organizations Unrealistic:** Thrive during collapse
5. **Famine System Broken:** 0 triggers despite food 0.229
6. **Outcome Detection Wrong:** Extinction classified as Status Quo

---

## üß™ **Realistic Mortality Test Run (NEW - Oct 13)**

### **Changes Implemented:**
```
OLD SYSTEM:
- Risk > 0.7 ‚Üí 10% chance cascade trigger
- Cascade ‚Üí 2% monthly mortality (hard-coded)
- Irreversible, binary (on/off)

NEW SYSTEM:
- Risk > 0.5 ‚Üí continuous cascade (severity 0-1)
- Mortality calculated from state thresholds:
  * Food < 0.4 ‚Üí 0.01%/month additional
  * Water < 0.4 ‚Üí 0.008%/month additional
  * Climate < 0.6 ‚Üí non-linear escalation
  * Biodiversity < 0.3 ‚Üí 0.003%/month additional
  * 8-9 boundaries ‚Üí 2.25x amplifier
- Can REVERSE if risk < 0.45
- Tech improves state ‚Üí reduces mortality
```

### **Expected Results:**
- **Baseline (Month 0-20):** 0.009% monthly mortality (72M deaths/year globally)
- **Cascade Start:** Later (Month 30-50 instead of Month 18)
- **Population Decline:** Gradual (years, not months)
- **Some Survivals:** With aggressive interventions
- **Outcome Detection:** Still broken (needs separate fix)

### **Status:** ‚è≥ Running (Run 3/10, Month 68 as of latest check)

**Preliminary Observations (Month 68, Run 3):**
- Population: 0.885B (89% decline, slower than old 83% by Month 75)
- Cascade active: 44.2M deaths this month (~5% monthly mortality)
- 6 crises active, 3.0x degradation
- **Interpretation:** Still collapsing but more realistically paced

## üéØ **Next Actions**

### **Priority 1: Fix Outcome Detection (CRITICAL)**
**File:** `src/simulation/endGame.ts`

Add environmental extinction checks:
```typescript
// Slow extinction from environmental collapse
if (population < startingPopulation * 0.3) return 'extinction';
if (state.planetaryBoundariesSystem.cascadeActive) {
  const monthsSince = currentMonth - cascadeStartMonth;
  if (monthsSince > 60 && population < startingPopulation * 0.5) {
    return 'extinction'; // 5+ years cascade + 50% mortality
  }
}
if (foodSecurity < 0.3) {
  // Track sustained food crisis
  if (monthsSustained > 24) return 'extinction';
}
```

### **Priority 2: Organization Bankruptcy During Collapse**
**Files:** `src/simulation/organizations.ts`, `src/simulation/agents/organizationAgent.ts`

Add crisis penalties:
```typescript
// Revenue collapse when customers die
if (populationDecline > 0.3) {
  monthlyRevenue *= (1 - populationDecline * 0.8);
}

// Bankruptcy during cascading crises
if (activeCrises >= 5 && foodSecurity < 0.4) {
  bankruptcyRisk += 0.15 * activeCrises;
}

if (Math.random() < bankruptcyRisk) {
  // Liquidate organization
}
```

### **Priority 3: Fix Famine System**
**File:** `src/simulation/qualityOfLife.ts` ‚Üí `checkRegionalFamineRisk()`

Debug why food security 0.229 doesn't trigger famines:
1. Check threshold values (should trigger < 0.4)
2. Verify regional food security calculation
3. Ensure famine system is active
4. Log trigger attempts for diagnosis

### **Priority 4: Test New Mortality System**
**Status:** ‚è≥ In progress (`realistic_mortality_test` Monte Carlo)

Wait for completion, then analyze:
- Does baseline mortality match research? (0.009% monthly)
- Does cascade trigger later?
- Is decline more gradual?
- Do interventions reduce mortality?
- Any Utopia outcomes?

## üìà **Success Metrics**

### **Outcome Detection:**
‚úÖ Environmental extinction recognized as "Extinction" (not "Status Quo")  
‚úÖ Distinguish rapid (nuclear/AI) from slow (environmental) extinction  
‚úÖ "Status Quo" only when population stable + low crises

### **Organizations:**
‚úÖ Bankruptcies increase during population collapse  
‚úÖ Revenue tied to population/economic health  
‚úÖ Some orgs survive, but most fail during apocalypse

### **Famine System:**
‚úÖ Famines trigger when food security < 0.4  
‚úÖ Regional famines based on local food availability  
‚úÖ Famine deaths integrated with environmental mortality

### **Mortality System:**
‚úÖ Baseline matches research (9M deaths/year at 7/9 boundaries)  
‚úÖ Cascade triggers realistically (risk management, not random)  
‚úÖ Mortality scales with actual state thresholds  
‚úÖ Tech interventions reduce mortality through state improvement  
‚úÖ Some runs survive with aggressive interventions  
‚úÖ Extinction is possible but not guaranteed

## üí° **Key Insights**

### **The Core Problem**
The simulation's environmental systems work correctly (cascade triggers, degradation accelerates, population declines), but **three** downstream systems fail:
1. **Outcome classification** - doesn't recognize environmental extinction
2. **Organization behavior** - unrealistic during collapse  
3. **Famine integration** - food crisis doesn't trigger famines

### **Why This Matters**
- **For Model Validity:** Can't trust Monte Carlo results if outcomes are misclassified
- **For Utopia Analysis:** Can't measure intervention effectiveness if "Status Quo" includes apocalypse
- **For Realism:** Organizations and famines are critical societal systems

### **The Fix is Straightforward**
All three issues have clear solutions and can be implemented quickly:
- Outcome detection: Add 3 new checks (10 lines of code)
- Organization collapse: Add crisis penalties (20 lines)  
- Famine system: Debug threshold logic (investigate + fix)
