# Interactive Dynamics Visualization System

## Overview
Created a comprehensive interactive graphing system to make balancing the simulation easier by providing detailed visibility into all key dynamics over time.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸ“Š **Dynamics Tab**
A new dedicated tab for exploring system dynamics with:
- **Interactive metric selection**: Click any metric to toggle it on/off the main graph
- **Multi-metric comparison**: View up to 5 metrics simultaneously
- **Organized by category**: Economy, Society, AI, and Government sections
- **Real-time updates**: Graph updates as simulation progresses
- **Full historical tracking**: All metrics tracked from game start

### ðŸ“ˆ **Tracked Metrics** (13 total)

**Economy (4 metrics)**
- Unemployment Level
- Economic Transition Stage (0-4)
- Wealth Distribution
- Quality of Life

**Society (5 metrics)**
- Social Adaptation (overall)
- Trust in AI
- Social Stability
- Coordination Capacity
- AI Economic Dependence

**AI (2 metrics)**
- Total AI Capability
- Average AI Alignment

**Government (2 metrics)**
- Effective Control
- Government Legitimacy

### ðŸŽ¨ **User Experience**
- **Color-coded metrics**: Each metric has a distinct color for easy identification
- **Current values display**: Large, clear displays of current metric values
- **Selection feedback**: "On Graph" badges show which metrics are active
- **Smart limits**: Maximum 5 metrics to prevent visual clutter
- **Category organization**: Logical grouping makes finding metrics intuitive

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

**Enhanced Game Store**
```typescript
// Added comprehensive metrics history tracking
history: {
  metrics: Array<{
    month: number;
    unemployment: number;
    socialAdaptation: number;
    trustInAI: number;
    // ... 10 more metrics
  }>;
}
```

**Monthly Updates**
- All 13 metrics captured every month
- Stored in efficient array structure
- Available for historical analysis

**Interactive Charts**
- Recharts LineChart with proper legend
- Smooth line rendering (no animation for performance)
- Proper axis labels and tooltips
- Responsive container design

## Benefits for Development

### **Easier Balancing**
- See exactly how each metric evolves over time
- Identify which dynamics are too fast/slow
- Spot unexpected interactions between systems
- Compare different metrics side-by-side

### **Better Debugging**
- Visual confirmation that formulas work as expected
- Quick identification of broken dynamics
- Clear feedback on tuning parameter changes
- Historical data preserved for analysis

### **Improved Understanding**
- See relationships between metrics
- Understand feedback loops visually
- Identify which metrics drive others
- Validate game design intentions

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with key relationships**: 
   - Unemployment + Social Adaptation + Economic Stage
   - Trust in AI + AI Alignment + Effective Control

2. **Look for problems**:
   - Metrics that plateau too quickly
   - Unexpected inverse relationships
   - Values that exceed intended bounds
   - Metrics that change too fast/slow

3. **Compare categories**:
   - How do society metrics respond to AI changes?
   - Does government control track with AI capability?
   - Are economic metrics progressing logically?

4. **Test scenarios**:
   - Use evil switches while watching alignment metrics
   - Observe unemployment response to stage transitions
   - Track trust changes during policy implementation

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Export chart data to CSV
- Zoom/pan on time axis
- Set metric thresholds with visual indicators
- Compare multiple simulation runs
- Derivative/rate of change graphs
- Correlation matrix view
- Individual AI agent tracking
