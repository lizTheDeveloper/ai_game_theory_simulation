# Session Summary - October 13, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. **Memory Leak Fix** 🐛
**Problem**: 600-month simulation crashed at 4GB heap after 160 months  
**Root Cause**: `state.eventLog` accumulated 44,238 events (never cleaned up)  
**Solution**: EventCollectionPhase now caps eventLog at 5000 events (~24 months)  
**Result**: Memory stays at ~3.7GB for full 600-month runs ✅

### 2. **Performance Issue Diagnosed** 🔍
**Problem**: 30-40 minute runtimes for 600-month x 10-run MC  
**Root Cause**: 687 `console.log` statements generating 8-10M log lines  
- Run 3 alone: 829,623 lines (184,175 information warfare events!)
- I/O bound, not CPU bound

**Solution Strategy**: Event aggregation + selective logging
- **Keep**: Critical events (nuclear wars, extinctions, milestones)
- **Aggregate**: Routine events (cyber attacks, deepfakes) → 12-month summaries
- **Expected**: 95% log reduction, 5-10x speedup

### 3. **Event Aggregation Infrastructure** 📊
**Created**:
- `src/simulation/eventAggregator.ts` - Tracks statistics, provides summaries
- `scripts/runMonteCarlo.sh` - Proper runner script for MC management
- Integration in `engine.ts` - Auto-report every 12 months
- Comprehensive optimization plan in `plans/logging-optimization.md`

**Example Output**:
```
📊 EVENT SUMMARY (Months 0-12)
🛡️  INFORMATION WARFARE:
   Cyber attacks: 200 (195 blocked, 5 succeeded)
   Deepfakes: 50 (42 detected, 8 undetected)
   Defense rate: 97.5%
```

### 4. **TIER 2.9 Government Environmental Actions** 🌍
- 4 new government actions (Amazon, coral, pesticides, tech funding)
- Environmental crisis priority logic (5x-25x multiplier)
- Tech deployment acceleration (2x speed with funding)
- Government responds to planetary boundaries

### 5. **Realistic Timeline Recalibration** 🌍
- Biodiversity: 10x slower degradation (-0.5%/year realistic)
- Ecosystem collapse: Multi-phase over 5+ years
- Amazon, coral, pollinator tipping points with regional impacts
- Extended MC to 600 months (50 years)

## Commits Today

1. `ce9b11f` - TIER 2.9 + Memory leak fix + Timeline recalibration
2. `5b0411c` - Disable verbose logging (reverted in favor of aggregation)
3. `9a99839` - Event aggregation infrastructure

## Current State

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- **Running**: 10 runs x 600 months (started 17:17)
- **Runtime**: 9.5 minutes elapsed (still on run 3-4)
- **Memory**: 3.7GB (healthy, leak fixed!)
- **ETA**: ~30-40 minutes total (with verbose logging)

### Next Steps - Logging Refactor

**Phase 1 (High Priority)** - High-volume files:
- [ ] `defensiveAI.ts` (32 logs) → 8 critical + aggregator
- [ ] `nuclearDeterrence.ts` (29 logs) → 15 critical + aggregator  
- [ ] `conflictResolution.ts` (12 logs) → Keep most (milestones)

**Phase 2** - Medium volume:
- [ ] `breakthroughTechnologies.ts` → Aggregate deployments
- [ ] `organizationManagement.ts` → Aggregate routine ops
- [ ] `environmental.ts` → Aggregate routine warnings

**Phase 3** - Polish:
- [ ] Test 5x120 month with aggregation
- [ ] Measure performance improvement
- [ ] Update documentation

**Estimated**: 6-8 hours total for complete refactor

## Performance Projections

### Current (Verbose)
- Log size: ~1GB per 10 runs
- Runtime: 30-40 min (I/O bound)
- Lines: ~8.3M for 10 runs

### After Refactor (Aggregated)
- Log size: ~100MB per 10 runs (90% reduction)
- Runtime: 5-8 min (5-8x speedup, CPU bound)
- Lines: ~400K for 10 runs (95% reduction)

## Key Insights

1. **Console logging IS fast** - stdout is buffered/optimized
2. **Volume is the problem** - 8M lines = massive I/O
3. **Proper abstractions matter** - Runner scripts, event aggregators
4. **Summary > Details** - "200 attacks blocked" > 200 individual logs
5. **Memory leaks are subtle** - GC works, but references persist
6. **Profiling reveals truth** - Heap profiling identified real issue

## Research Applied

- **Logging best practices**: Netflix chaos engineering (aggregate events)
- **SRE principles**: Google's structured logging with counters
- **Unix philosophy**: Use stdout, but aggregate before persisting
- **Performance**: Buffered I/O ~100x faster than unbuffered

## Files Modified

**Today's changes**:
- 14 files modified (memory leak fix, TIER 2.9, timeline)
- 1,686 lines added (simulation logic)
- 6 files added (infrastructure, plans, devlogs)
- 558 lines added (event aggregation)

**Total**: 2,244 lines added across 20 files

## Notes

- Original MC still running (healthy progress)
- Memory leak completely fixed
- Event aggregation infrastructure ready
- Actual logging refactor is next major task
- Expected 5-10x speedup once complete

## Collaboration Notes

**What worked well**:
- Proper profiling revealed the real issue
- User insight: "console is fast, volume is the problem"
- Infrastructure-first approach (aggregator before refactor)

**Next session priorities**:
1. Complete Phase 1 logging refactor
2. Test performance improvements
3. Analyze MC results once complete
