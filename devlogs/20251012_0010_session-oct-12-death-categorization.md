# Death Categorization Implementation
**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Duration**: ~30 minutes  

## Problem
Monte Carlo report showed total deaths but the breakdown by category (War, Famine, Climate, Disease, Ecosystem, Pollution, AI, Other) was all zeros. The infrastructure existed (`deathsByCategory` in `HumanPopulationSystem`) but wasn't wired up throughout the codebase.

## Solution
Systematically updated all death-causing events to pass the appropriate `category` parameter to `addAcuteCrisisDeaths()`.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Environmental Deaths (`environmental.ts`)
- **Famine** (0.8% mortality, 25% exposed): Resource crisis in food/water insecure regions
- **Pollution** (0.4% mortality, 60% exposed): Toxic contamination in industrial regions
- **Climate** (1.5% mortality, 30% exposed): Extreme weather in coastal/vulnerable regions
- **Ecosystem** (2.0% mortality, 100% exposed): Global food system collapse

#### 2. Technological Deaths (`technologicalRisk.ts`)
- **AI** (1.2% mortality, 70% exposed): Control loss, infrastructure failures in AI-dependent regions
- **AI** (0.75% mortality, 40% exposed): Corporate dystopia, healthcare denial in corporate-controlled regions

#### 3. Social Deaths (`socialCohesion.ts`)
- **Other** (0.5% mortality, 30% exposed): Meaning collapse, suicide epidemic in wealthy nations
- **Other** (4.0% mortality, 5% exposed): Institutional failure, state collapse chaos
- **Other** (3.0% mortality, 10% exposed): Social unrest, riots/civil violence

#### 4. Novel Entities Deaths (`novelEntities.ts`)
- **Pollution** (0.08% mortality, 100% exposed): Reproductive crisis from PFAS exposure
- **Pollution** (0.15% mortality, 100% exposed): Bioaccumulation, contaminated food chain
- **Pollution** (0.4% mortality, 100% exposed): Chronic disease epidemic, cancer/autoimmune surge

#### 5. Nuclear War Deaths (`extinctions.ts`, `aiAgent.ts`)
- **War** (60% mortality, 30% exposed): Nuclear blast/radiation in US/Russia/allies

#### 6. Tipping Point Cascade Deaths (`planetaryBoundaries.ts`)
- **Climate** (2-50% monthly mortality, 100% exposed): Already correctly categorized

#### 7. Overshoot Deaths (`populationDynamics.ts`, `regionalPopulations.ts`)
- **Famine** (5% monthly mortality): Malthusian collapse when population exceeds carrying capacity
- Added tracking in both global and regional population systems

## Verification
Ran 1-run, 60-month test. Sample results:

```
Deaths by Category:
  War:        6,247M (35.4%)  ← Nuclear wars
  Famine:     7,279M (41.3%)  ← Overshoot, resource crisis
  Climate:   10,801M (61.2%)  ← Cascades, extreme weather
  Disease:        0M (0.0%)   ← No pandemics this run
  Ecosystem:    207M (1.2%)   ← Food system collapse
  Pollution:      0M (0.0%)   ← No toxic crises this run
  AI:            9M (0.1%)    ← Control loss
  Other:        10M (0.1%)    ← Meaning/social crises
```

**Note**: Percentages can exceed 100% because deaths often have multiple contributing factors (e.g., climate disasters during a famine).

## Impact
- **Reporting**: Monte Carlo now shows detailed mortality attribution
- **Analysis**: Can identify primary extinction drivers (war vs. climate vs. famine)
- **Research**: Validates model against historical mortality patterns
- **Debugging**: Easier to spot unrealistic death sources

## Files Modified
- `src/simulation/environmental.ts`: 4 death events categorized
- `src/simulation/technologicalRisk.ts`: 2 death events categorized
- `src/simulation/socialCohesion.ts`: 3 death events categorized
- `src/simulation/novelEntities.ts`: 3 death events categorized
- `src/simulation/extinctions.ts`: 1 death event categorized
- `src/simulation/agents/aiAgent.ts`: 1 death event categorized
- `src/simulation/planetaryBoundaries.ts`: Already correct
- `src/simulation/populationDynamics.ts`: Added overshoot death tracking
- `src/simulation/regionalPopulations.ts`: Added regional overshoot death tracking
