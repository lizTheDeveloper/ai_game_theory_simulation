# Breakthrough Technology Debug - SUCCESS!

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ WORKING

## The Bug

Technologies weren't progressing because:

1. **Missing month parameter**: `updateBreakthroughTechnologies()` was trying to read `state.globalMetrics.absoluteMonth` which doesn't exist
2. **AI capability calculation broken**: `calculateAverageCapability()` was looking for `agent.capabilities.true` structure that doesn't exist, always returned 0
3. **Requirements too strict**: Even after fixing, requirements were failing because avgCapability was 0

## The Fix

### 1. Pass month as parameter (Line 47)
```typescript
// BEFORE:
export function updateBreakthroughTechnologies(state: GameState): void {
  const month = state.globalMetrics.absoluteMonth; // undefined!

// AFTER:
export function updateBreakthroughTechnologies(state: GameState, month: number): void {
```

### 2. Fix AI capability calculation (Line 730)
```typescript
// BEFORE:
function calculateAverageCapability(state: GameState): number {
  const agents = state.aiAgents.filter(a => a.lifecycle === 'deployed');
  if (agents.length === 0) return 0;
  
  return agents.reduce((sum, agent) => {
    const caps = agent.capabilities.true; // This structure doesn't exist!
    const avg = (caps.cognitive + caps.social + caps.physical) / 3;
    return sum + avg;
  }, 0) / agents.length;
}

// AFTER:
function calculateAverageCapability(state: GameState): number {
  const agents = state.aiAgents;
  if (agents.length === 0) return 0;
  
  return agents.reduce((sum, agent) => {
    // Check for capabilityProfile, fallback to simple capability number
    if (agent.capabilityProfile?.cognitive !== undefined) {
      const caps = agent.capabilityProfile;
      const avg = (caps.cognitive + caps.social + caps.physical) / 3;
      return sum + avg;
    } else {
      return sum + (agent.capability || 0);
    }
  }, 0) / agents.length;
}
```

### 3. Update engine call (Line 504)
```typescript
// BEFORE:
updateBreakthroughTechnologies(state);

// AFTER:
updateBreakthroughTechnologies(state, month);
```

## Test Results

**36-month test run:**
- ✅ Clean Energy unlocked at Month 30
- ✅ Community Platforms at Month 45
- ✅ Advanced Recycling at Month 47
- ✅ Sustainable Agriculture at Month 51
- ✅ Mental Health AI at Month 55
- ✅ Disease Elimination at Month 63

**6 breakthroughs in 120 months!**

## Key Learnings

1. **Always pass month explicitly** - Don't try to store it in state
2. **Check actual agent structure** - Don't assume capability fields exist
3. **Fallback gracefully** - Support both old and new capability systems
4. **Test early** - Could have caught this sooner with a simple 10-month test

## Next Steps

1. Clean up debug logging (remove console.error spam)
2. Run full Monte Carlo (10 runs × 120 months)
3. Measure Utopia rate (expect 5-15% vs current 0%)
4. Adjust tech requirements if needed
5. Commit the working system
