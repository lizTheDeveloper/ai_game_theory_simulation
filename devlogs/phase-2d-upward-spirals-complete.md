# Phase 2D Complete: Upward Spirals System

**Date:** October 8, 2025 (Evening)  
**Branch:** `feature/nuclear-war-fix-and-dynamics`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Testing in progress

## What Was Implemented

### The Problem
- **0% Utopia rate** in all Monte Carlo runs
- Existing Utopia check was too simple: "Golden Age + no crises"
- Missing the **virtuous cascade** mechanic (we had vicious cascades but no positive counterpart)
- The spec requires **3+ sustained upward spirals** for Utopia, not just "no problems"

### The Solution: 6 Upward Spirals

Implemented complete spiral system in `src/simulation/upwardSpirals.ts`:

#### 1. **Abundance Spiral** 🌾
```
Condition: Material abundance (1.5+) + Energy (1.5+) + Time liberation (60%+ unemployed in Stage 3+)
Strength: Weighted combo of all three factors
Result: Post-scarcity achieved when all align
```

#### 2. **Cognitive Spiral** 🧠
```
Condition: Mental health (disease <30%) + Purpose (meaning crisis <30%) + AI augmentation (capability 1.5+, trust 60%+)
Strength: Combination of health, purpose, and cognitive enhancement
Result: Humans become smarter, healthier, more capable
```

#### 3. **Democratic Spiral** 🗳️
```
Condition: Quality governance (decision + capacity >70%) + Engagement (participation + transparency >60-70%) + Not authoritarian
Strength: Weighted governance metrics
Result: Liquid democracy working, people engaged, decisions good
```

#### 4. **Scientific Spiral** 🔬
```
Condition: Multiple breakthroughs (4+ unlocked) + High research ($50B+/month) + AI acceleration (capability 2.0+)
Strength: Progress rate, deployment, investment, AI capability
Result: Science accelerating exponentially
```

#### 5. **Meaning Spiral** ✨
```
Condition: Meaning fulfilled (<20%) + Strong community (cohesion >70%) + Cultural adaptation (>70%) + Autonomy & creativity (>70%)
Strength: Purpose, community, adaptation, freedom
Result: People have meaningful lives, not just material comfort
```

#### 6. **Ecological Spiral** 🌍
```
Condition: Ecosystem healthy (>70%) + Climate stable (>70%) + Biodiversity (>70%) + Low pollution (<30%) + Resources sustainable (>70%)
Strength: All environmental metrics
Result: Planet healing, not dying
```

### Virtuous Cascade Mechanics

**Trigger:** 4+ spirals active simultaneously

**Effects:**
- **1.2x amplification** with 4 spirals
- **1.4x amplification** with 5 spirals
- **1.6x amplification** with 6 spirals

**Logged like cascading failures:**
```
🌟✨ VIRTUOUS CASCADE BEGINS (Month X)
   6 upward spirals active → 1.6x amplification
   Active spirals: Abundance, Cognitive, Democratic, Scientific, Meaning, Ecological
```

**Cross-Amplification:**
- Each spiral makes others easier to maintain
- Research becomes more effective
- Crisis resolution accelerates
- QoL improvements compound

### NEW Utopia Condition

**Old (WRONG):**
```typescript
// Just check Golden Age + no crises + sustainability >65%
if (goldenAge && noCrises && sustainability > 0.65) {
  return Utopia;
}
```

**New (CORRECT - from spec):**
```typescript
function canDeclareUtopia(state: GameState) {
  // Count spirals active for 12+ months
  const sustainedSpirals = countSpiralsActive12Months(state);
  
  // Check for active crises
  const activeCrises = countActiveCrises(state);
  
  // Utopia requires 3+ sustained spirals + no crises
  return sustainedSpirals >= 3 && activeCrises === 0;
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Multiple paths to Utopia:** Abundance + Cognitive + Democratic (material path), or Scientific + Meaning + Ecological (cultural path), etc.
- **Sustainability requirement:** Must sustain spirals for 12+ months (not just momentary)
- **Clear win condition:** Achieve and maintain 3+ spirals

## Integration

**In `engine.ts`:**
```typescript
// After governance quality update
updateUpwardSpirals(newState, newState.currentMonth);
```

**In `endGame.ts`:**
```typescript
function canDeclareUtopia(state: GameState) {
  const { canDeclareUtopia: spiralCheck } = require('./upwardSpirals');
  return spiralCheck(state);
}
```

**In `types/game.ts`:**
```typescript
interface GameState {
  // ... existing fields
  upwardSpirals: UpwardSpiralState; // Phase 2D
}
```

**In `initialization.ts`:**
```typescript
upwardSpirals: initializeUpwardSpirals(),
```

## Expected Impact

### Before (0% Utopia)
```
Outcome Distribution:
  Utopia:     0 / 10 (0.0%)   ← IMPOSSIBLE!
  Dystopia:   6 / 10 (60.0%)
  Extinction: 4 / 10 (40.0%)
```

**Why:** We were checking for the wrong thing. No proper virtuous feedback loops.

### After (Predicted: 10-20% Utopia)
```
Outcome Distribution:
  Utopia:     1-2 / 10 (10-20%)  ← NOW ACHIEVABLE!
  Dystopia:   5-6 / 10 (50-60%)
  Extinction: 2-3 / 10 (20-30%)
```

**Why:** 
- Proper Utopia detection (3+ sustained spirals)
- Virtuous cascades make spirals self-reinforcing
- Multiple pathways (not just one condition)
- Nuclear war fix should reduce extinction rate

## Testing

**Running now:**
```bash
logs/mc_upward_spirals_test_20251008_215044.log
```

**What to watch for:**
1. Do we see `🌟✨ VIRTUOUS CASCADE BEGINS` messages?
2. Do any runs achieve 3+ sustained spirals?
3. Are there Utopia outcomes (>0%)?
4. Is nuclear war less frequent? (should be ~30% of extinctions, not 75%)

## Technical Implementation

**Files Created:**
- `src/simulation/upwardSpirals.ts` (426 lines) - Core spiral system

**Files Modified:**
- `src/types/game.ts` - Added `upwardSpirals` field
- `src/simulation/initialization.ts` - Initialize spirals
- `src/simulation/engine.ts` - Call `updateUpwardSpirals()` each month
- `src/simulation/endGame.ts` - Use spiral-based Utopia detection

**Exports:**
- `initializeUpwardSpirals()` - Create initial state
- `updateUpwardSpirals(state, month)` - Monthly update
- `canDeclareUtopia(state)` - Check if Utopia achievable
- `getVirtuousCascadeMultiplier(state)` - For external use (research acceleration)

## Why This Was The Key Missing Piece

1. **Spec Compliance:** The original design doc says "Utopia requires 3+ upward spirals sustained". We weren't checking this!

2. **Asymmetry Fixed:** We had vicious cascades (crisis amplification) but no virtuous cascades (positive amplification). Now we have both!

3. **Multiple Paths:** Instead of one "Golden Age" condition, there are now C(6,3) = 20 different combinations of 3 spirals that can trigger Utopia.

4. **Narrative Clarity:** When a player wins, they'll see exactly which spirals they achieved:
   - "Utopia achieved via Abundance + Democratic + Ecological spirals"
   - vs generic "Utopia: high QoL sustained"

5. **Emergent Gameplay:** Players can now pursue different strategies:
   - **Tech path:** Scientific + Cognitive + Abundance
   - **Cultural path:** Meaning + Democratic + Cognitive
   - **Eco path:** Ecological + Abundance + Scientific
   - **Balanced path:** All 6 spirals → maximum amplification

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Results** - Check Monte Carlo output for Utopia outcomes
2. **Balance if Needed** - Adjust spiral thresholds if too easy/hard
3. **Phase 2E** - Implement Meaning Renaissance (expand spiral 5)
4. **Phase 2F** - Add Conflict Resolution systems

## Lessons Learned

- **Always check the spec!** The 0% Utopia was because we implemented the wrong condition.
- **Symmetric systems:** If you have cascading failures, you need cascading successes too.
- **Test assumptions:** "Golden Age = Utopia" seemed reasonable but wasn't what the spec said.
- **Emergent complexity:** 6 simple spirals → 20 possible Utopia paths

**Status:** Testing now, results pending. This should finally enable Utopia outcomes! 🎉
