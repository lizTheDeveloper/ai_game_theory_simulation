# Realistic Timeline Recalibration - October 12, 2025

## Problem Identified
User questioned the simulation's rapid ecosystem collapse timeline:
- **Simulation showed**: Ecosystem collapse Month 8 (April 2026), mass die-offs by June 2026
- **Reality**: October 12, 2025 → July 2026 is only 9 months away
- **Issue**: Way too fast! Scientific consensus shows tipping points 2030-2035, severe collapse 2040-2070

## Research Conducted
Used Tavily search to find realistic timelines:
- **Amazon**: 25% deforestation triggers 50-year transition to savanna (Lovejoy & Nobre 2018)
- **Coral reefs**: 15-year mass die-off after aragonite < 3.5 (IPCC SR15, Hughes et al. 2018)
- **Insect pollinators**: 1-2%/year decline, crisis at 65% loss (Sánchez-Bayo 2019, IPBES 2019)
- **General collapse**: Tipping points 2030-2035, major impacts 2040-2060 (Armstrong McKay et al. 2022)

## Changes Implemented

### Phase 1: Core Biodiversity Recalibration ✅
**File: `src/simulation/environmental.ts`**

1. **Slowed degradation rate 10x**:
   - Before: `0.005` per month = 6%/year ❌
   - After: `0.0004` per month = 0.5%/year ✅
   - All contributing factors reduced proportionally

2. **Lowered collapse threshold**:
   - Before: 30% biodiversity = immediate apocalypse ❌
   - After: 20% biodiversity = tipping point (collapse process begins) ✅

3. **Added time lag system**:
   ```typescript
   ecosystemCollapse: {
     triggered: boolean;
     triggeredAt: number;
     monthsSinceTrigger: number;
     phase: 'declining' | 'crisis' | 'collapse';
   }
   ```

4. **Gradual death escalation**:
   - **Phase 1 - DECLINING (0-2 years)**: 0.01% mortality/month, regional (5% of world)
   - **Phase 2 - CRISIS (2-5 years)**: 0.1% mortality/month, spreading (40% of world)
   - **Phase 3 - COLLAPSE (5+ years)**: 1-2% mortality/month, global (100% of world)

5. **Regional differentiation**:
   - Tropical regions and islands hit first
   - Agricultural regions in mid-phase
   - Global food system failure only in final phase

**Result**: Collapse now takes 20-40 years after threshold, not 2 months

### Phase 2: Specific Tipping Points ✅
**File: `src/simulation/specificTippingPoints.ts` (NEW)**

Implemented three major tipping point systems with realistic regional impacts:

#### 1. Amazon Rainforest
- **Current**: 20% deforested (2025 baseline)
- **Tipping point**: 25% deforestation
- **Timeline**: 50-year transition to savanna (600 months)
- **Regional impact**: South America first (Brazil, Peru, Colombia, etc.)
- **Global impact**: 200 Gt CO2 release, +0.2-0.3°C warming
- **Mechanics**:
  - Deforestation rate influenced by economic growth, resource extraction, climate feedback
  - Carbon release accelerates over time as trees die
  - Regional droughts first decade, global climate impacts thereafter

#### 2. Coral Reef System
- **Current**: 70% health (30% already degraded)
- **Tipping point**: <30% health (aragonite < 3.5)
- **Timeline**: 15-year mass die-off (180 months)
- **Regional impact**: Pacific islands, Caribbean, SE Asia, Australia
- **Global impact**: 25% of marine species, 3B people food security
- **Mechanics**:
  - Decline from ocean acidification, warming, pollution
  - Fishery collapse proportional to coral loss
  - Regional famines in marine-dependent areas

#### 3. Insect Pollinators
- **Current**: 60% of 1970 levels (40% decline already)
- **Critical threshold**: 35% (65% total decline)
- **Impact**: 35% of food production at risk
- **Regional impact**: All agricultural regions globally
- **Mechanics**:
  - Decline from habitat loss, pesticides, climate stress
  - Food production loss proportional to pollinator decline
  - Agricultural regions experience crop failures
  - Quarterly famine impacts scaling with severity

### Phase 3: Long-Term Systems (Deferred)
**Permafrost** (2050+) and **AMOC** (2080+) were spec'd but not implemented yet, as they only become relevant after 50+ years.

### Phase 4: Extended Monte Carlo ✅
**File: `scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts`**
- Changed default duration: 120 months → **600 months (50 years)**
- Rationale: Must run long enough to show realistic collapse timeline
- Can still override with `--max-months=X` flag

## Expected Outcomes

### Before (Current State)
- Ecosystem collapse: Month 6-8 (April 2026)
- Mass deaths: Month 8-10 (June 2026)
- Near extinction: Month 20 (June 2027)
- **Timeline: Unrealistically fast** ❌

### After (Realistic State)
- No collapse: Months 0-60 (Years 0-5) - slow degradation only
- Tipping points: Months 60-120 (Years 5-10) - threshold crossings
- Crisis phase: Months 120-300 (Years 10-25) - accelerating failures
- Severe collapse: Months 300-600 (Years 25-50) - systemic failure
- **Timeline: Matches scientific consensus** ✅

## Validation Metrics

Run 50-year Monte Carlo and verify:
1. ✅ No ecosystem collapse before 2030 in any run
2. ✅ Tipping points crossed 2030-2040 range
3. ✅ Death rates escalate gradually (years, not months)
4. ✅ Regional impacts before global
5. ✅ Window for intervention visible (2025-2035)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/simulation/environmental.ts` - Biodiversity rates, collapse phases, time lags
2. `src/simulation/planetaryBoundaries.ts` - Cascade biodiversity rate (slower)
3. `src/types/game.ts` - Added `ecosystemCollapse` and `specificTippingPoints` state
4. `src/simulation/engine.ts` - Integrated `updateSpecificTippingPoints()`
5. `src/simulation/initialization.ts` - Initialize tipping points

### Files Created
1. `src/simulation/specificTippingPoints.ts` - Amazon, coral, pollinator systems
2. `plans/realistic-timeline-recalibration.md` - Implementation plan
3. `devlogs/realistic-timeline-recalibration-oct12.md` - This file

### Integration Points
- Specific tipping points update each month after environmental accumulation
- Deaths flow through existing `addAcuteCrisisDeaths()` with regional fraction
- QoL impacts scale gradually over phases
- Event log tracks tipping point crossings and phase transitions

## Next Steps

1. **Run Monte Carlo** (600 months, 10 runs):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/annhoward/src/ai_game_theory_simulation
   npx tsx scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts > logs/realistic_timeline_mc_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Validate results**:
   - Check collapse timing distribution
   - Verify regional vs global death patterns
   - Confirm tipping point activation timeline
   - Look for Utopia windows (intervention opportunities)

3. **Document findings**:
   - Update wiki with realistic timelines
   - Add to TIER 1 completion notes
   - Inform TIER 2 intervention timing

## Key Insight
**The simulation wasn't wrong about WHAT happens, just WHEN.**

- The collapse it showed in 2026-2027 is actually **2040-2070**
- But the **point of no return** (tipping point) is **2030-2035**
- We have **5-10 years to prevent**, not 8 months ✅
- If we don't act by 2035, we're locked into the 2040-2070 collapse ⚠️

This makes the simulation much more realistic while preserving the core dynamics and the urgency for intervention.
