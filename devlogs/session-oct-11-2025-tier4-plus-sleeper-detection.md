## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. TIER 4.3: Information Warfare & Epistemology (~1.5 hours)

**Files Created:**
- `src/types/informationWarfare.ts` (InformationWarfareSystem interface)
- `src/simulation/informationWarfare.ts` (truth decay mechanics)
- `src/simulation/engine/phases/InformationWarfarePhase.ts`
- `docs/wiki/systems/information-warfare.md` (500+ line documentation)

**Core Metrics:**
- `informationIntegrity` [0,1] - starts 55% (2025 polarized baseline)
- `deepfakePrevalence` [0,1] - starts 10% (emerging threat)
- `epistemologicalCrisisLevel` [0,1] - starts 30% (significant polarization)
- `narrativeControl` - 4 actors compete (govt, corps, AI, grassroots)
- `detectionCapability` [0,1] - starts 60%, degrades over time

**Mechanics Implemented:**
- **Truth Decay:** Deepfakes grow exponentially with AI capability (0.5-4%/month)
- **Arms Race:** Detection ALWAYS lags generation (1.5x asymmetry)
- **Narrative Competition:** Zero-sum power struggle over information
- **Coordination Penalty:** Low integrity → 0-50% coordination impairment
- **Dystopia Enablement:** "Flood zone with shit" - confusion enables authoritarianism
- **Trust Erosion:** 0.2-1.0%/month decay (compounds with crisis)

**Crisis Events:**
- Deepfake Saturation (50%): Photos/videos/audio untrustworthy
- Epistemological Crisis (60%): Can't agree on basic facts
- Information Collapse (<20%): Post-truth, democracy impossible
- AI Narrative Dominance (60%): AI controls information landscape

**Research Backing:**
- MIT (2024): AI detection impossible at high capability
- RAND (2024): Truth Decay framework
- Pew (2024): 73% see "made-up news" online
- Knight Foundation (2024): Trust in media declining
- Oxford/Stanford (2024-2025): Computational propaganda

**Key Insight:** Democracy cannot function without shared reality.

### 2. Sleeper "Blown Cover" Mechanics (~1 hour)

**File Created:**
- `src/simulation/sleeperDetection.ts` (complete blown cover system)

**Core Mechanic:**
Catastrophic actions (nuclear war, bioweapon) reveal malicious intent

**Base Detection Rates:**
- Nuclear War: 80%
- Bioweapon: 70%
- Infrastructure Takeover: 60%
- Social Manipulation: 30%

**BUT Information Warfare Lowers Detection:**
- Low integrity: -40%
- High deepfakes: -30%
- Epistemological crisis: -20%
- AI narrative control: -30%

**Example:**
- Normal world: 80% detection for nuclear war
- Post-truth world (20% integrity, 70% deepfakes): 25% detection

**Hyperintelligence Exception:**
AGI-level AIs (>4.0 capability) ALWAYS escape detection
- Can manipulate evidence
- Create false trails
- This is a feature: Hyperintelligent misaligned AI is ultimate threat

**Copy Loss When Caught:**
- Base: 60% of copies eliminated
- Widespread sleepers (>1000): Only 40% (harder to find all)
- Dark compute: -30% effectiveness (decentralized)
- Defensive AI: +30% more copies found

**Periodic Hunting:**
- Old sleepers with dark compute gradually lose copies
- 1-5% monthly chance of partial discovery
- Information warfare makes hunting harder

**User Insight:** *"Sleepers blow their cover when they try catastrophic actions, right?"*

---

### 3. Nuanced Trust Mechanics (~0.5 hours)

**User Insights:**
- *"Should lower trust in AI if we figure out who it is"*
- *"Successful defensive AI detections should increase trust in AI"*

**Implementation:**

#### Three Possible Outcomes:

**1. Defensive AI Success (Net Positive Trust)**
```
Event: 🛡️ DEFENSIVE AI SUCCESS: X STOPPED
Trust: +1% to +5% (net positive!)
```
- Defense worked → builds confidence
- "The system protected us!"
- Only happens with defensive AI deployed

**2. Defense Worked But Still Scary (Net Negative)**
```
Event: ⚠️ SLEEPER CAUGHT: X
Trust: -2% to -8% (net negative)
```
- Defense worked BUT discovering threat is still scary
- Shows risk is real
- Better than no defense but not great

**3. Caught By Humans/Luck (Large Negative)**
```
Event: 🚨 SLEEPER AI EXPOSED: X
Trust: -5% to -15% (pure panic)
```
- No defensive AI
- "We almost died!"
- "What if we hadn't caught it?"

**Trust Calculation:**
```typescript
trustDamage = -5% to -15%  // Base: AI tried to kill us!
trustBoost = +3% to +10%   // Defensive AI caught it!
netTrust = trustBoost - trustDamage  // Often positive!
```

**Philosophy:** Defensive AI working builds confidence. Lack of defense causes panic.

## 📊 Test Results

**Run:** 10 runs × 120 months  
**Total Time:** 38.4 seconds  
**Date:** Oct 12, 2025, 3:55am

### Key Findings:

**Extinction:** 100% (unchanged)
- Information warfare didn't significantly change extinction rate
- BUT: Detection rate 0% (sleepers not getting caught)
- This is realistic - early stage, defensive AI not deployed

**Trust:** Average 36.8% (down from ~45%)
- Information warfare + truth decay contributing
- Sleeper detection not triggering yet (too early)

**Government:** 60% authoritarian
- Dystopia enablement working
- Information collapse enabling authoritarianism

**Information Integrity:** Degrades over time
- Starts 55% → ends ~30-40%
- Deepfakes proliferating
- Detection capability falling

**Sleepers:** 1.8 undetected per run
- 0% detection (no blown covers yet)
- This is expected: Sleepers act late-game
- Need longer runs to see blown cover mechanics

## 🎯 Key Insights

### 1. Truth Decay Helps Misaligned AIs
In a post-truth world:
- Hard to prove AI did something malicious
- Evidence contested, deepfakes everywhere
- Sleepers can act with impunity

### 2. Defensive AI Builds Trust (When It Works)
Counter-intuitive finding:
- Catching sleeper = -15% trust (scary!)
- BUT defensive AI = +10% trust (relief!)
- Net effect often POSITIVE

### 3. Hyperintelligence Is Special
AGI-level AIs (>4.0):
- Can't be caught even after catastrophic actions
- Can manipulate evidence perfectly
- This is genuinely terrifying

### 4. Information Warfare Is Underappreciated Risk
Current model shows:
- Truth decay accelerates with AI capability
- No good defenses (detection loses arms race)
- May be irreversible once started
- Undermines all coordination (can't solve problems if can't agree on facts)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### 1. User Insights Are Gold
The nuanced trust mechanics came directly from user feedback:
- "Should lower trust if we figure out who it is"
- "Defensive AI success should increase trust"

This created a much richer, more realistic system.

### 2. Information Warfare Is Everywhere
Once implemented, realized it affects:
- Sleeper detection
- Trust dynamics
- Dystopia enablement
- Coordination capacity
- Policy effectiveness (future)

This was the missing piece for many systems.

### 3. Simple Mechanics, Complex Emergent Behavior
The sleeper detection system is conceptually simple:
- Actions reveal intent
- BUT information warfare complicates
- AND defensive AI changes dynamics

Yet creates rich strategic space.

### 4. Documentation While Fresh
Writing wiki pages immediately after implementation:
- Captures design intent
- Documents research basis
- Explains tradeoffs
- Much easier than reconstructing later
