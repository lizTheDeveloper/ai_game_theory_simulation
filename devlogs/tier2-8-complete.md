# TIER 2.8 COMPLETE: Hegemonic Powers & Climate Justice

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Branch:** `tier2-major-mitigations`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (70/70 tests passing)

---

## Executive Summary

TIER 2.8 adds critical geopolitical realism to the simulation by modeling:
1. **Resource extraction & sovereignty** (who controls what resources)
2. **Military capabilities & interventions** (power projection, wars)
3. **War-meaning feedback loops** (why nations go to war)
4. **Climate justice & environmental debt** (historical responsibility)

All systems are research-backed, tested, and integrated into the simulation engine.

---

## Phase 1: Resource Endowments & Sovereignty

**Implementation:** `src/simulation/resourceEndowments.ts` (310 lines)

### Core Mechanics

**Resource Types:**
- Oil & Gas (Middle East, Russia)
- Rare Earth Elements (China: 100% dominance)
- Strategic Minerals (DRC cobalt, Chile lithium)
- Biodiversity (Brazil: 100% Amazon basin)
- Uranium (Canada: 85%)

**Sovereignty Calculation:**
```typescript
sovereignty = (
  economicSovereignty * 0.4 +
  politicalSovereignty * 0.3 +
  militarySovereignty * 0.3
)
```

**Resource Curse:**
- Nigeria: 75% oil reserves, but only 25% sovereignty (extraction by hegemons)
- Venezuela: High oil, low sovereignty due to sanctions/intervention
- DRC: 70% cobalt, 20% sovereignty (colonial extraction patterns)

### Research Backing
- Ross (2012): "The Oil Curse" - Resource wealth → authoritarianism
- Acemoglu & Robinson (2012): "Why Nations Fail" - Extractive institutions
- UN COMTRADE: Resource flow data
- World Bank: Sovereignty indicators

### Test Results
**22 tests passing** (Phase 1&2 combined)
- ✅ All 15 countries initialized with resource data
- ✅ Nigeria oil curse validated (high oil, low sovereignty)
- ✅ China rare earth dominance (100%)
- ✅ US sovereignty highest (>0.9)

---

## Phase 2: Military System & Interventions

**Implementation:** `src/simulation/militarySystem.ts` (285 lines)

### Military Capabilities

**Power Projection Scale [0, 1]:**
- 1.0: United States (750 bases, global reach)
- 0.80: China (regional dominance, growing global)
- 0.70: Russia (regional, limited global)
- 0.45: UK, France (expeditionary forces)
- 0.30: India (regional power)

**Military Spending:**
- US: $877B/year (SIPRI 2024)
- China: $292B/year
- Russia: $109B/year

**Military CO2 Emissions:**
- US military: 59M tons/year (more than 140 countries!)
- Doubles during active interventions (Iraq/Afghanistan: +60%)
- Often invisible in climate accounting

### Intervention Mechanics

**Intervention Types:**
- Regime change (Iraq 2003, Libya 2011)
- Proxy war (Syria, Yemen, Ukraine)
- Occupation (Afghanistan 2001-2021)
- Resource securing (oil fields, strategic minerals)

**Effects Tracked:**
- Refugees created (millions displaced)
- CO2 emissions (invisible in most accounting)
- Moral injury (veteran PTSD)
- AI development (military R&D, DARPA model)

### Research Backing
- Neta Crawford (2019): Pentagon emissions > 140 countries
- SIPRI (2024): Military spending database
- Vine (2015): "Base Nation" - 750 US bases globally
- Costs of War Project: Iraq/Afghanistan impacts

### Test Results
**22 tests passing** (Phase 1&2 combined)
- ✅ US highest military capability (1.0)
- ✅ US military emissions validated (59M tons/year)
- ✅ War emissions double during interventions
- ✅ Nigeria identified as intervention target (resource curse + low sovereignty)

## Phase 3: War-Meaning Feedback Loop

**Implementation:** `src/simulation/warMeaningFeedback.ts` (345 lines)

### Core Theory

**User Insight:**
> "Becoming a mom dulled my lust for war. I don't want to destroy anymore, I want to nurture."

**Feedback Loop:**
```
Meaning Crisis → Nationalism → War Motivation
       ↑                               ↓
       └──── Moral Injury ←────────────┘
             (negative feedback)
```

### Meaning Crisis Sources

**Higher in:**
- Wealthy, automated societies (US: 0.45, Japan: 0.40)
- Atomized cultures (Putnam 2000: "Bowling Alone")
- Post-industrial economies

**Lower in:**
- Traditional family structures (India: 0.25)
- Strong community bonds
- Purpose-providing cultures

### Nationalism Dynamics

**Amplifiers:**
- Historical grievances
- Rival threats (Israel: 0.75 - existential threat perception)
- Economic insecurity
- Identity politics

**Formula:**
```typescript
warMotivation = meaningCrisis * nationalism - moralInjury + resourceDependence
```

**Dampeners:**
- Parental fulfillment (nurturing > destroying threshold: 2.5)
- Moral injury from past wars (Iraq/Afghanistan: 11-20% veteran PTSD)
- Alternative purpose (community, creativity, stewardship)

### Research Backing
- Durkheim (1912): Anomie (loss of social bonds → crisis)
- Putnam (2000): Social capital decline in US
- Junger (2016): "Tribe" - War as purpose substitute
- Terror Management Theory (2006): Nationalism as existential buffer
- VA Data: 11-20% of Iraq/Afghanistan vets have PTSD

### Test Results
**22 tests passing**
- ✅ US high meaning crisis (0.45) + nationalism (0.55) = high war potential
- ✅ Israel highest nationalism (0.75) - existential threat
- ✅ Germany lowest nationalism (0.30) - post-WWII anti-nationalism
- ✅ Non-hegemons cannot initiate interventions (only US, China, Russia)
- ✅ Parental fulfillment dampens war motivation

## Phase 4: Climate Justice & Environmental Debt

**Implementation:** `src/simulation/climateJustice.ts` (391 lines)

### Climate Debt Calculation

**Formula:**
```typescript
debt = emissionsShare × (1 - sufferingRatio) × climateSeverity × 1000
```

**Examples:**
- **US**: 400 Gt emissions, 0.05× suffering → Owes $118.75B
- **China**: 220 Gt emissions, 0.3× suffering → Owes $48.13B
- **Bangladesh**: 1 Gt emissions, 50× suffering → Receives reparations

**Suffering Ratios:**
- Sub-Saharan Africa: Suffers 28× more than they caused
- Small island nations: ∞ (zero emissions, total destruction)
- US: Suffers 0.05× what they caused (buffered by wealth)

### Reparations Flow

**Monthly Transfers:**
```typescript
transfer = debt × willingness × capacity × internationalPressure × 0.01
```

**Willingness [0, 1]:**
- Germany: 0.60 (Green Party, EU climate leadership)
- US: 0.30 (political polarization, fossil fuel lobbies)
- Russia: 0.10 (authoritarian, fossil fuel economy)
- Climate victims: 0.0 (receivers, not payers)

**Effects:**
- Reparations reduce climate suffering (adaptation funding)
- Each $1B reduces suffering by 0.1% (diminishing returns)

### Migration Pressure

**Drivers:**
- Sea level rise (Bangladesh, Indonesia, island nations)
- Droughts & desertification (Sub-Saharan Africa)
- Extreme weather events
- Food insecurity

**Amplification:**
- Coastal nations: 2× pressure (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nigeria)
- When pressure > 0.1: Population emigration begins (1% per month max)

### Green Technology Transfer

**Transferable Technologies:**
- Clean Energy (solar, wind)
- Carbon Capture
- Sustainable Agriculture
- Ecosystem Management

**Transfer Rate:**
```typescript
capacity = willingness × techsUnlocked × climateSeverity × 0.1
```

**Recipients:**
- Countries with sufferingRatio > 2.0
- Haven't received much yet (< 5.0)

**Effects:**
- Green tech reduces emissions (1% per month with tech > 1.0)

### Research Backing
- IPCC AR6 (2021): Historical climate responsibility
- Loss and Damage Fund (COP27 2022): $100B/year commitment
- Climate Equity Reference Calculator
- Our World in Data: Cumulative CO2 emissions by country
- UNHCR (2024): 1B climate displaced by 2050

### Test Results
**26 tests passing**
- ✅ Climate debt calculated correctly (US: $118.75B, China: $48.13B)
- ✅ Bangladesh receives reparations (high suffering, low emissions)
- ✅ Reparations accumulate over time (monotonic)
- ✅ Migration pressure builds in coastal nations (2× amplification)
- ✅ Green tech transfers when technologies unlocked
- ✅ Tech transfer scales with climate severity
- ✅ Full system integration stable for 60 months

## Key Insights from Simulations

### 1. Climate Justice Debt Flows

**Rich Emitters (Debtors):**
- US owes ~$118.75B (at 50% climate severity)
- China owes ~$48.13B
- Debt scales linearly with climate severity

**Climate Victims (Creditors):**
- Bangladesh receives reparations (50× suffering ratio)
- Nigeria receives reparations (coastal + high suffering)
- Indonesia receives reparations (island nation)

### 2. Migration Pressure Dynamics

**Coastal Amplification:**
- Bangladesh migration pressure: 2× baseline
- Population decline begins when pressure > 0.1
- Emigration rate: 1% per month (max)

**Compounding Factors:**
- Food insecurity: +50% pressure
- Water scarcity: +100% pressure
- Climate severity: Linear multiplier

### 3. Green Technology Transfer

**Transfer Conditions:**
- Requires unlocked technologies (clean energy, carbon capture)
- Scales with climate urgency (severity multiplier)
- Limited by donor willingness (Germany: 0.6, US: 0.3)

**Emission Reductions:**
- Countries with greenTechReceived > 1.0: -1% emissions/month
- Cumulative effect over 5 years: -40% emissions

### 4. War-Meaning Feedback

**High-Risk Hegemons:**
- US: 0.45 meaning crisis + 0.55 nationalism = high war potential
- Russia: 0.38 meaning crisis + 0.70 nationalism = high war drive
- Israel: 0.40 meaning crisis + 0.75 nationalism = highest drive

**Dampening Factors:**
- Parental fulfillment > 2.5: War motivation → 0
- Moral injury > 0.3: -30% war motivation
- Alternative purpose (community): -50% motivation

### 5. Resource Extraction Patterns

**Resource Curse Validation:**
- Nigeria: 75% oil, 25% sovereignty → intervention target
- Venezuela: High oil, low sovereignty → sanctions/coups
- DRC: 70% cobalt, 20% sovereignty → extraction continues

**Sovereignty Protection:**
- US: >90% sovereignty (military + economic power)
- Germany: >85% sovereignty (EU integration, rule of law)
- China: >80% sovereignty (authoritarian control)
