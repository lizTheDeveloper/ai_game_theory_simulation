# P2 Implementation Progress - October 16, 2025

## Branch: `p2-implementation`

## Completed

### ✅ P2.1: Environmental Degradation Rate Calibration (4 hours)
**Status:** Complete and committed (8285402)

**What was done:**
- Added `applyStochasticVariance()` function to environmental.ts
- Applied ±20% variance to climate degradation (IPCC uncertainty)
- Applied ±30% variance to biodiversity loss (ecological uncertainty)
- Applied ±25% variance to resource depletion (economic variability)

**Research basis:**
- IPCC AR6 (2021-2023): SSP5-8.5 uncertainty ranges (3.3-5.7°C)
- IPBES 2019: Ecological system variability
- Global Footprint Network 2024: Resource dynamics

**Impact:** Prevents deterministic environmental trajectories, adds realistic scientific uncertainty

### ✅ P2.2: Stochastic Innovation Breakthroughs (4 hours)
**Status:** Complete and committed (8285402)

**What was done:**
- Created `StochasticInnovationPhase.ts` with 5 breakthrough types:
  - Fusion power (0.1% base probability)
  - Gigatonne carbon capture (0.2% base)
  - AI alignment solution (0.15% base)
  - Synthetic food production (0.3% base)
  - Room-temperature superconductors (0.2% base)
- Breakthrough probability scales with:
  - Crisis pressure (+1% per active crisis)
  - AI capability (+0.5% per capability point, max +5%)
  - Prerequisite technologies (5x multiplier if prerequisites met)
- Added `achievedBreakthroughs` and `breakthroughsThisRun` tracking to GameState
- Registered phase in engine (order 8.5, after tech breakthroughs, before environment)

**Research basis:**
- Epoch AI Compute Trends (2024): 4-5x annual growth
- Historical examples: CRISPR (12y), Transformers (5y), mRNA vaccines (crisis-accelerated)
- Pew Research: Crisis-driven innovation patterns

**Impact:** Adds positive "unknown unknowns", prevents every run from doom, enables some doomed runs to be saved by timely breakthroughs

**Target distribution:** 70-85% of runs get 0 breakthroughs, 10-20% get 1, 3-7% get 2, <3% get 3+

## In Progress

### 🔄 P2.4: Organization Geographic Diversification (3-4 hours)
**Status:** Starting next (prioritized over P2.3 due to lower complexity)

**Plan:**
- Add Global North/South regional classification to organizations
- Different resource access, climate vulnerability, regulatory environments
- Affects organization viability, technology deployment speed, crisis impact

### ⏳ P2.3: Heterogeneous Population Segments (8-10 hours)
**Status:** Pending (most complex P2 task)

**Plan:**
- Elite/middle/working class segmentation
- Distinct QoL trajectories, resource consumption patterns
- Different political influence and crisis resilience
- Inequality metrics and dystopia triggers

### ⏳ P2.5: Empirical Validation Against Historical Data (6-8 hours)
**Status:** Pending (should be done last to validate all P2 changes)

**Plan:**
- Validate against 1950-2025 trajectories:
  - Climate (temperature, CO2 levels)
  - GDP per capita
  - Population growth
  - Technology adoption curves (internet, mobile, etc.)
- Ensure simulation matches historical baselines before diverging

## Estimated Remaining Effort

- P2.4: 3-4 hours
- P2.3: 8-10 hours
- P2.5: 6-8 hours
- **Total remaining:** 17-22 hours

## Next Steps

1. Implement P2.4 (Geographic Diversification)
2. Implement P2.3 (Heterogeneous Population Segments)
3. Implement P2.5 (Historical Validation)
4. Run Monte Carlo validation (100 runs)
5. Update P2_RESEARCH_PLAN.md with implementation notes
6. Move plan to plans/completed/
7. Update wiki documentation

## Research Quality Notes

- All implementations follow research-backed specifications from P2_RESEARCH_PLAN.md
- Stochastic variance prevents deterministic outcomes
- Breakthrough system balances doom bias with realistic innovation potential
- Geographic and population diversity will add critical realism dimensions
