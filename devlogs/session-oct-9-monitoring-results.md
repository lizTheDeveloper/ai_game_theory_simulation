# Monte Carlo Results: Organizations & Breakthrough Tech

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Test:** 10 runs × 120 months with org contributions + breakthrough tech

## Results Summary

### Outcomes
- **Utopia:** 0% (0/10) - Still no utopia path
- **Dystopia:** 60% (6/10) - Surveillance/control dominant
- **Extinction:** 40% (4/10) - All rapid extinction
- **Detection Rate:** 0% for sleepers, 0 sandbagging detections

### Technology Breakthroughs
- **Avg per Run:** 266 breakthroughs! ✅
- **System Working:** Technologies ARE unlocking throughout simulations
- **Deployment:** Unknown - need to check if they're being deployed

### Key Metrics
- **Economic Stage:** 3.05 avg (post-scarcity achieved)
- **Unemployment:** 95% avg (expected in post-work)
- **Trust in AI:** 1.00 avg (very high!)
- **Social Stability:** 0.11 avg (very low - crises dominant)
- **Wealth Distribution:** 0.695 avg (relatively equal)

## Analysis

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Breakthrough tech system functioning**
   - 266 unlocks per run = ~2.2 breakthroughs/month
   - Research allocation working
   - Tech tree progressing

2. **Organizations exist and have behaviors**
   - Racing dynamics present
   - Safety vs profit tensions present
   - (Can't verify contributions yet - no logging)

3. **Economic transition happening**
   - Stage 3.05 = post-scarcity
   - 95% unemployment = automation working
   - High trust despite crises

### ❌ What's Not Working

1. **Still 0% Utopia**
   - Crisis resolution might not be triggering
   - Or crises cascade faster than tech can recover
   - Or utopia requirements too strict
   - Or deployment too slow

2. **High dystopia rate (60%)**
   - Surveillance state dominant
   - Government control path winning
   - Not balanced against tech optimism

3. **Crisis cascades still dominant**
   - Social stability 0.11 = multiple crises active
   - Tech unlocking but not preventing/resolving
   - Need to verify crisis resolution logic

## Next Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Crisis Resolution
```bash
grep -i "crisis resolved\|pollution resolved\|climate averted" logs/*.log
```
Expected: Should see ✅✅✅ messages if crises are being resolved  
Actual: Need to check

### 2. Check Technology Deployment
```bash
grep -i "deployment\|deployed.*tech\|scaling" logs/*.log
```
Question: Are technologies being deployed at scale after unlock?

### 3. Check Organization Contributions
```bash
grep -i "private research\|organization.*research\|safety.*contrib" logs/*.log
```
Question: Are companies actually contributing? (No logging yet)

### 4. Check Utopia Requirements
Look at `canDeclareUtopia()` in `endGame.ts`:
- Golden Age 12+ months? ✅ (Probably happening)
- High sustainability? ❓ (Maybe not with crises)
- No active crises? ❌ (Probably blocking)

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Tech Unlocks But Doesn't Deploy Fast Enough
- **Symptom:** 266 breakthroughs but 0% utopia
- **Cause:** `deploymentLevel` stays low, effects don't apply
- **Fix:** Add automatic deployment scaling after unlock

### Hypothesis 2: Crises Cascade Faster Than Tech Can Resolve
- **Symptom:** Social stability 0.11, dystopia 60%
- **Cause:** 6 crises active → 3.0x degradation overwhelming
- **Fix:** Either tech deploys faster OR crisis resolution more aggressive

### Hypothesis 3: Utopia Requirements Too Strict
- **Symptom:** 0% utopia despite high trust, post-scarcity
- **Cause:** "No active crises" requirement impossible to meet
- **Fix:** Allow utopia with resolved (but not absent) crises

### Hypothesis 4: Crisis Resolution Not Triggering
- **Symptom:** No "CRISIS RESOLVED" messages in logs (need to verify)
- **Cause:** Threshold conditions never met, or logic bug
- **Fix:** Check if pollution < 0.5 ever happens after tech deployment

## Organization Impact (Estimated)

Since we added org research/risk but can't see logs yet:

### Research Contributions
- Anthropic ($3M, safety 0.95): ~$0.2M/month
- Meta ($30M, safety 0.7): ~$1.5M/month
- **Total:** ~$2-3M/month private
- **Government:** ~$10-30B/month
- **Ratio:** ~0.01% private (negligible but realistic)

### Risk Amplification
- Racing orgs (capabilityRace > 0.8): OpenAI, Google
- **Effect:** +0.005-0.015/month misalignment
- **Impact:** Modest - probably not dominant factor

## Recommendations

1. **Add deployment logging** - See when tech scales up
2. **Add crisis resolution logging** - Verify it's working
3. **Add org contribution logging** - See private research in action
4. **Test crisis resolution manually** - Isolated test case
5. **Relax utopia requirements?** - Or make tech more powerful

**Status:** Early implementation phase - tech unlocks working, full system not yet integrated  
**Next session:** Debug crisis resolution + deployment + utopia pathway
