Beginning implementation of Positive Tipping Point Cascades system.

**Plan:** /plans/positive-tipping-points-plan.md
**Goal:** Widen 2% humane utopia pathway to 7-17% (+5-15%)
**Research:** OECD 2025, ESD 2024, Nature Sustainability 2023 (TRL 6-8)
**Complexity:** 8-12 hours (5 interacting systems)

**Implementation Phases:**
1. State & Types (2-3h) - Add positive tipping point state tracking
2. Core Mechanics (3-4h) - Cascade detection, S-curve dynamics, learning curves
3. Integration (2-3h) - Phase creation, orchestrator registration, logging
4. Validation (1-2h) - Monte Carlo N=10, verify cascade triggers

**Expected Impact:**
- Humane utopia rate: 2% → 7-17%
- Clean tech adoption: 20-40% faster
- Cascade triggers: 5-15% of runs

Starting Phase 1: State & Types

**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 21:28 | [IN-PROGRESS]

Phase 1 COMPLETE: State & Types

**Created:**
- `/src/types/positiveTippingPoints.ts` - Complete type system
  - TechnologyAdoption interface (market share, S-curves, learning curves)
  - PositiveTippingEvent tracking (cascade triggers, impact metrics)
  - TechnologySynergy (circular economy loops)
  - Research parameters (OECD 2025 thresholds: 5-20% market share)

**Modified:**
- `/src/types/game.ts` - Added positiveTippingPoints: PositiveTippingPointsState

**Research Parameters Encoded:**
- Cascade thresholds: 5-20% market share (OECD 2025)
- Cascade multipliers: 1.5-2.4x growth acceleration
- Learning rates: 20-30% cost reduction per doubling (NREL)
- Cascade duration: 60-180 months (Nature Sustainability 2023)

Starting Phase 2: Core Mechanics

Phases 1-3 COMPLETE: Implementation Done

**Phase 1 (State & Types):**
- Created `/src/types/positiveTippingPoints.ts` with full type system
- Added to GameState interface in `game.ts`

**Phase 2 (Core Mechanics):**
- Created `/src/simulation/positiveTippingPoints.ts` (650+ lines)
- Implemented S-curve adoption (Bass diffusion model)
- Implemented cascade detection (5-20% thresholds, multi-factor triggers)
- Implemented Wright's Law learning curves (2x production → 20-30% cost reduction)
- Implemented cross-technology synergies (EV + battery, solar + wind)
- Integrated with resource economy (CO2 reduction, cost savings)

**Phase 3 (Integration):**
- Created `PositiveTippingPointsPhase.ts` (order 20.5)
- Registered in PhaseOrchestrator
- Added cascade event logging
- Export added to phase index

**Key Features:**
- 5 technologies tracked: solar PV, EVs, wind, heat pumps, battery storage
- Baseline 2025 adoption rates (solar 6%, EV 3%, wind 8%)
- Cascade triggers: price parity OR policy support OR social threshold
- Environmental impact: 50 Mt CO2/month at full clean tech adoption
- Cost savings tracked and applied to economic metrics

Starting Phase 4: Monte Carlo Validation

**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 22:10 | [VALIDATION]

Implementation COMPLETE - Running Final Validation

**Bug Fix Applied:**
- Fixed CO2 integration: `state.resourceEconomy.co2.annualEmissions` (not `.carbonEmissions.current`)
- Cascades now trigger without errors

**Cascade Confirmation (Single Simulation Test):**
- solar-pv: Triggered at month 0 (price parity, 6% market share)
- wind-power: Triggered at month 0 (price parity, 8% market share)
- electric-vehicles: Triggered ~month 5 (price parity, 5% market share)
- heat-pumps: Triggered ~month 10 (price parity, 5.3% market share)

**Mechanics Working:**
- S-curve adoption dynamics functional
- Cascade strength calculation (48-49% observed)
- Price parity detection working
- Learning curves active (Wright's Law)
- Environmental impact integration (CO2 reduction)

**Final Validation:**
- Monte Carlo N=10, 240 months running in background
- Will check humane utopia rate improvement once complete
- Expected: 2% → 7-17% humane utopia rate

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/src/types/positiveTippingPoints.ts` (new)
- `/src/simulation/positiveTippingPoints.ts` (new, 650 lines)
- `/src/simulation/engine/phases/PositiveTippingPointsPhase.ts` (new)
- `/src/types/game.ts` (added positiveTippingPoints field)
- `/src/simulation/initialization.ts` (added init call)
- `/src/simulation/engine.ts` (registered phase)
- `/src/simulation/engine/phases/index.ts` (added export)

Awaiting final validation results...
