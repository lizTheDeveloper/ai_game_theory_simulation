# Dimensional Capability Mapping - Expansion Phase
**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (18/30 complete)

## Progress Summary

### Technologies Mapped: 18 / ~30 needed

**Batch 1 (Original):** 8 technologies
- Soil P Optimization (cognitive + digital)
- P-Efficient Cultivars (biotech.geneEditing)
- Advanced Desalination (materials.nanotechnology + physical)
- Aquifer Mapping AI (cognitive + digital)
- Ocean Alkalinity (climate research + physical)
- Mental Health AI (social + cognitive + biotech.neuroscience)
- Advanced Mech Interp (cognitive + selfImprovement + CS.architectures)
- Defensive AI (digital + cognitive + CS.security)

**Batch 2 (Today):** 10 technologies
1. ✅ Atmospheric Water Harvest - materials.nanotechnology + cognitive
2. ✅ Drought-Resistant Crops - biotech.geneEditing + cognitive
3. ✅ Coral Restoration - biotech.geneEditing + physical + cognitive
4. ✅ PFAS Remediation - cognitive + physical (chemistry)
5. ✅ Plastic-Eating Enzymes - biotech.syntheticBiology + cognitive
6. ✅ AI Community Matching - social + cognitive
7. ✅ Creative Empowerment Tools - cognitive + social
8. ✅ Scalable Oversight - cognitive + selfImprovement + CS.algorithms
9. ✅ Formal Verification - cognitive + selfImprovement + CS.algorithms (advanced)

## Remaining High-Priority (12 technologies)

### Medical (3)
- [ ] Disease Elimination - biotech.drugDiscovery + biotech.geneEditing
- [ ] Longevity Therapies - biotech.drugDiscovery + biotech.neuroscience
- [ ] Personalized Medicine - cognitive + biotech.drugDiscovery

### Energy (2)
- [ ] Fusion Power - physical + cognitive + materials.quantumComputing
- [ ] Advanced Nuclear - physical + cognitive

### Climate (2)
- [ ] Climate Engineering - climate.intervention + climate.modeling
- [ ] Carbon Removal (industrial) - cognitive + climate.mitigation

### Alignment (1)
- [ ] Constitutional AI - cognitive + CS.security

### Future Tech (4)
- [ ] Nanotech Assembly - materials.nanotechnology + physical
- [ ] Quantum Computing - cognitive + CS.algorithms + materials.quantumComputing
- [ ] Brain-Computer Interfaces - biotech.neuroscience + cognitive + digital
- [ ] Advanced Robotics - physical + cognitive + selfImprovement
- [ ] Synthetic Biology (advanced) - biotech.syntheticBiology + cognitive

## Philosophy Applied

✅ **ONLY adding dimensional requirements where AI is essential**
- Drought crops need gene editing (biotech)
- PFAS needs chemistry optimization (cognitive + physical)
- Creative tools need generative models (cognitive + social)

❌ **NOT adding for infrastructure/political/existing tech**
- UBI, purpose networks, treaties (political will, not AI)
- Struvite recovery, offshore wind (existing tech, just scaling)
- Green chemistry (industrial transformation over time)

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining 12 high-priority technologies
2. Test with Monte Carlo to validate unlocks
3. Update wiki documentation
4. Consider: How should tech spread between countries?
