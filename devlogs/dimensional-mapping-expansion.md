# Dimensional Capability Mapping - Expansion Phase
**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (18/30 complete)

## Progress Summary

### Technologies Mapped: 24 / ~30 needed

**Batch 1 (Original):** 8 technologies

- P-Efficient Cultivars (biotech.geneEditing)
- Advanced Desalination (materials.nanotechnology + physical)
- Aquifer Mapping AI (cognitive + digital)
- Ocean Alkalinity (climate research + physical)
- Mental Health AI (social + cognitive + biotech.neuroscience)
- Advanced Mech Interp (cognitive + selfImprovement + CS.architectures)
- Defensive AI (digital + cognitive + CS.security)

**Batch 2 (Today):** 16 technologies
1. ✅ Atmospheric Water Harvest - materials.nanotechnology + cognitive
2. ✅ Drought-Resistant Crops - biotech.geneEditing + cognitive
3. ✅ Coral Restoration - biotech.geneEditing + physical + cognitive
4. ✅ PFAS Remediation - cognitive + physical (chemistry)
5. ✅ Plastic-Eating Enzymes - biotech.syntheticBiology + cognitive
6. ✅ AI Community Matching - social + cognitive

14. ✅ Climate Engineering (SAI) - cognitive + physical + climate.modeling + climate.intervention
15. ✅ Value Learning - cognitive + social + selfImprovement + CS.algorithms

## Remaining Lower-Priority (~6 technologies)

### Future Tech (Optional - Clarketech)
- [ ] Nanotech Assembly - materials.nanotechnology + physical
- [ ] Quantum Computing - cognitive + CS.algorithms + materials.quantumComputing
- [ ] Brain-Computer Interfaces - biotech.neuroscience + cognitive + digital
- [ ] Advanced Robotics - physical + cognitive + selfImprovement
- [ ] Synthetic Biology (advanced) - biotech.syntheticBiology + cognitive
- [ ] Recursive Alignment - cognitive + selfImprovement (very advanced)

**Note:** These are far-future technologies that may not be reached in typical simulation runs. Can add dimensional mappings later if needed.

## Philosophy Applied

✅ **ONLY adding dimensional requirements where AI is essential**
- Drought crops need gene editing (biotech)
- PFAS needs chemistry optimization (cognitive + physical)
- Creative tools need generative models (cognitive + social)

❌ **NOT adding for infrastructure/political/existing tech**
- UBI, purpose networks, treaties (political will, not AI)
- Struvite recovery, offshore wind (existing tech, just scaling)
- Green chemistry (industrial transformation over time)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete high-priority dimensional mappings (24 technologies)
2. ⏳ Test with Monte Carlo to validate unlocks
3. ⏳ Tech spread between nations design (see: `plans/tech-spread-between-nations.md`)
4. ⏳ Update wiki documentation
