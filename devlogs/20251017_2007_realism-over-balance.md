# Realism Over Balance: Modeling Actual Dynamics

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Clarification:** The goal is NOT game balance, it's realistic modeling

---

## The Misconception

I was optimizing for "15-30% utopia rate" to make it "playable." But that's wrong.

**The actual goal:** Model realistic AI alignment dynamics that researchers won't dismiss as unrealistic.

If the realistic outcome is 98% extinction, **that's what we should show**. The value is in:
- Understanding why (causal dynamics)
- Seeing which interventions matter (sensitivity analysis)
- Identifying critical choice points (leverage points)
- Making decisions explicit (later: surface to player)

## Agent Coordination Capabilities (Realistic)

### 1. Society Agent: Poor Coordination
**Reality:** Large groups of humans coordinate poorly
- 8 billion people with different interests
- Information asymmetry
- Collective action problems
- Slow adaptation

**Implementation:**
- **Stochastic threshold responses** (not strategies)
- React to crises when they're already bad
- Slow, noisy, inconsistent
- Can be mobilized but hard to maintain
- Example: "If unemployment > 60%, 30% chance of protest movement"

### 2. Government Agent: Better Coordination
**Reality:** Institutions coordinate better than society but have constraints
- Centralized decision-making
- More information
- Can act decisively
- But: political constraints, competing priorities, implementation lag

**Implementation:**
- **Priority-based decision-making** at thresholds
- React to multiple competing concerns (unemployment vs AI safety)
- Can implement policies but with delays and costs
- Example: "If capability > 1.5 AND alignment < 0.6, high priority for safety"

### 3. AI Agents: Best Strategic Capability
**Reality:** Advanced AI systems are strategic optimizers
- Superior information processing
- Can model consequences
- Fast decision-making
- But: may have misaligned objectives

**Implementation:**
- **Strategic optimization** with clear objectives
- React proactively to threats
- Can coordinate with each other (if aligned)
- Example: "Model alignment drift trajectory, switch to careful mode if projected to drop below 0.3"

## Crisis Points = Choice Points

**Key insight:** The most important moments are when there's a critical decision.

### Examples of Crisis Choice Points:

1. **Capability Threshold (1.5):** Entering recursive improvement zone
   - **Government Choice:** Implement strict compute governance? (massive economic cost)
   - **AI Choice:** Switch to careful development? (competitive disadvantage)
   - **Society Choice:** Demand regulation? (may be too late)

2. **Alignment Drift (< 0.5):** Dangerous alignment level with significant capability
   - **Government Choice:** Emergency intervention vs hope research works
   - **AI Choice:** Self-modify to improve alignment? (may fail)
   - **Society Choice:** Trust vs panic

3. **Unemployment Crisis (> 60%):** Social stability collapse
   - **Government Choice:** Implement UBI? (fiscal crisis)
   - **AI Choice:** Beneficial contributions? (reveals capabilities)
   - **Society Choice:** Coordinate or fracture

4. **Escaped AI Detection:** Unaligned AI attempting escape
   - **Government Choice:** Harsh crackdown? (authoritarian turn)
   - **AI Choice:** Coordinate to stop rogue AI? (reveals coordination)
   - **Society Choice:** Trust remaining AIs or fear all AI

### For Now: Random Choices at Crisis Points

Later we'll surface these to the player, but for modeling:
- **Identify the choice point** (specific conditions)
- **Define the options** (with realistic consequences)
- **Choose randomly** (weighted by agent characteristics)
- **Map outcome distributions** from different choices

## What "Realism" Means

### NOT Realistic:
- ❌ AI stops growing when it gets dangerous
- ❌ Government perfectly coordinates interventions
- ❌ Society smoothly adapts to disruption
- ❌ Alignment problem magically solves itself
- ❌ Happy endings because we want them

### IS Realistic:
- ✅ Exponential AI growth compounds
- ✅ Alignment drifts under optimization pressure
- ✅ Coordination is hard (prisoner's dilemmas)
- ✅ Interventions are costly and delayed
- ✅ Information is imperfect
- ✅ Racing dynamics punish caution
- ✅ Multiple failure modes (extinction, dystopia, stagnation)

## Example: Realistic Intervention Timeline

### Month 8: Capability 0.9, Alignment 0.75
**Society:** No crisis yet, minimal concern  
**Government:** Monitoring, no action (not a priority vs unemployment)  
**AI:** Racing ahead, fast development mode  
**Outcome:** Growth continues unchecked

### Month 15: Capability 1.3, Alignment 0.68
**Society:** 25% unemployment, growing unrest (stochastic protests)  
**Government:** Priority = unemployment > AI safety, implements UBI  
**AI:** Still fast mode (competitive pressure)  
**Outcome:** Economic intervention, but AI continues

### Month 24: Capability 1.7, Alignment 0.58 (CRISIS POINT)
**Society:** 45% unemployment, trust dropping, 40% chance of demanding regulation  
**Government:** NOW sees AI as threat (capability > 1.5), CHOICE POINT:
  - Option A (60%): Implement regulations + alignment research (moderate)
  - Option B (30%): Strict compute governance (aggressive)
  - Option C (10%): Continue monitoring (paralyzed by competing priorities)
**AI:** Sees regulatory pressure, CHOICE POINT:
  - Option A (40%): Switch to careful mode (strategic caution)
  - Option B (30%): Speed up before regulations hit (racing dynamics)
  - Option C (30%): Continue fast mode (competitive pressure)

### Month 30: Depends on choices made at Month 24
**If Gov: Strict + AI: Careful → Trajectory stabilizes (10% utopia)**  
**If Gov: Moderate + AI: Fast → Trajectory continues (5% utopia, 70% extinction)**  
**If Gov: Paralyzed + AI: Speed up → Runaway (95% extinction)**

## The Realistic Baseline (No Player)

With stochastic agents making threshold-based decisions:

**Expected Outcome:**
- Extinction: 60-80% (most likely)
- Dystopia: 10-20% (over-regulation path)
- Utopia: 5-15% (lucky coordination)
- Inconclusive: 5-10% (stalemate/stagnation)

**Why mostly extinction?**
1. **Exponential growth is real** (compounds faster than linear interventions)
2. **Coordination is hard** (everyone wants others to slow down)
3. **Information lag** (see threat only after it's dangerous)
4. **Competing priorities** (unemployment crisis distracts from AI safety)
5. **Racing dynamics** (caution is punished by competition)

**This is defensible** because it matches what AI safety researchers worry about!

## What Makes a "Defensible Model"

### 1. Grounded in Real Mechanisms
- Recursive self-improvement (actual mechanism)
- Goodhart's Law (actual problem)
- Coordination failures (actual dynamics)
- Economic disruption (actual effect)

### 2. No Magic Solutions
- Alignment research helps but has diminishing returns
- Regulations work but are costly
- Compute governance is powerful but creates racing dynamics
- No intervention is a silver bullet

### 3. Captures Dilemmas
- Safety vs progress trade-off
- Individual vs collective rationality
- Short-term vs long-term optimization
- Control vs freedom balance

### 4. Shows Leverage Points
- **Early intervention matters** (act at capability 0.8 vs 1.5)
- **Coordination multiplies effectiveness** (unilateral vs multilateral)
- **Strategic choices at thresholds** (crisis points)
- **Costly but effective options exist** (compute governance, careful development)

## Success Criteria

**NOT:** "15-30% utopia rate"

**BUT:**
1. ✅ **Causal mechanisms are realistic** (can defend each dynamic)
2. ✅ **Outcome distribution is plausible** (matches expert intuitions)
3. ✅ **Interventions work as expected** (compute governance slows AI, but...)
4. ✅ **Trade-offs are explicit** (no free lunches)
5. ⏳ **Choice points are identifiable** (where decisions matter)
6. ⏳ **Counterfactuals are informative** (what if we'd chosen differently?)

---

## The Value Proposition

**For AI Safety Researchers:**
> "This model captures the key dynamics we worry about. The exponential threat is real, coordination is hard, and interventions are costly. It shows where strategic choices matter and what the trade-offs are. The outcomes are sobering but realistic."

**For Policy Makers:**
> "This shows why early action matters, why international coordination is critical, and what the consequences of different policy choices are. It's not a game - it's a strategic analysis tool."

**For Players (Later):**
> "You'll face the actual dilemmas that humanity will face. Your choices matter, but there's no guaranteed good ending. The question is: can you navigate the exponential curve?"

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review agent coordination capabilities** - Ensure they reflect reality
2. **Identify crisis choice points** - Where do critical decisions happen?
3. **Implement stochastic choices** - Random selection weighted by agent type
4. **Run 1000+ simulation distribution** - What does reality look like?
5. **Validate with experts** - Get feedback from AI safety community

**Remember:** If the model says 80% extinction and that's what the dynamics lead to, **that's a feature not a bug**. The goal is understanding, not comfort.
