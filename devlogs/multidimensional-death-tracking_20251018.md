# Multi-Dimensional Death Tracking Implementation

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Validation:** N=100 Monte Carlo (335.7s runtime)

## Problem

Death tracking was one-dimensional, mixing proximate causes (medical/physical) with root causes (systemic drivers). "Climate" appeared as a death category, but climate change doesn't directly kill people - it's a multiplier that drives other causes.

**User insight:** "Climate is an aggregate thing. There's no direct climate deaths. It's not like an avalanche or a tornado."

## Solution

Implemented **two-dimensional death tracking**:

### Dimension 1: Proximate Causes (What killed them)
Medical/physical cause of death:
- War (combat, weapons)
- Famine (starvation, malnutrition)
- **Disasters** (heat waves, floods, storms) ‚Üê renamed from "climate"
- Disease (pandemics, infections)
- Ecosystem (pollinator loss, collapse)
- Pollution (toxic environment)
- AI (alignment failure)
- Cascade (tipping point cascades)
- Other

### Dimension 2: Root Causes (Why it happened)
Underlying systemic driver:
- **Climate Change** (drives disasters, famine, disease, ecosystem)
- Conflict (war, geopolitical tensions)
- Governance (policy failures, institutional collapse)
- Alignment (AI alignment failure)
- Natural (non-climate natural disasters)
- Poverty (economic deprivation)
- Other

## Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **Type Definitions** (`src/types/population.ts`)
   - Renamed `deathsByCategory.climate` ‚Üí `deathsByCategory.disasters`
   - Added `deathsByRootCause` object (7 categories)

2. **Death Tracking** (5 locations)
   - Environmental deaths (`populationDynamics.ts:357-377`)
   - Heat waves (`wetBulbEvents.ts:519-523`)
   - Nuclear radiation (`RadiationSystemPhase.ts:44-72`)
   - Famines (`FamineSystemPhase.ts:46-86`) - proportional attribution by famine type
   - Overshoot deaths (`populationDynamics.ts:348-354`, `regionalPopulations.ts:389-394`)

3. **Reporting** (`populationDynamics.ts:881-926`)
   - Updated `logDeathSummary()` to display both dimensions
   - Clear separation: "PROXIMATE CAUSES (What killed them)" vs "ROOT CAUSES (Why it happened)"

4. **Monte Carlo** (`scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts:1089`)
   - Updated to use `disasters` instead of `climate`

## Validation Results (N=100, 120 months)

```
PROXIMATE CAUSES (What killed them):
  Famine:     97.3%
  Disease:     1.4%
  Ecosystem:   0.5%
  Disasters:   0.3%  ‚Üê Climate disasters happen (heat waves, floods)

ROOT CAUSES (Why it happened):
  Governance:      97.0%  ‚Üê Policy/distribution failures
  Climate Change:   0.3%  ‚Üê Climate creates stress
```

## Key Finding: "It was humans the whole time"

**Climate change creates the disasters** (0.3% direct deaths from heat waves/floods)

**BUT**

**Governance failures amplify them into mass death** (97% root cause)

This matches real-world famines:
- **Irish Potato Famine (1845-52):** Food exports continued during starvation
- **Bengal Famine (1943):** Food available but not distributed
- **Gaza (2024-25):** Aid blocked, not food shortage

Climate change is the **trigger**, governance is the **amplifier**.

## Research Backing

Multi-dimensional mortality attribution:
- **Proximate:** Medical/physical cause (ICD-10 classification)
- **Root:** Social determinants of health (WHO framework)
- **Famine research:** Sen's entitlement theory - famines are distribution failures, not production failures

## Impact

This tracking reveals:
1. **Where deaths happen** (proximate) vs **why they happen** (root)
2. **Climate creates stress**, but **policy converts stress into death**
3. **Most deaths are preventable** with better governance (resource distribution, crisis response)
4. **Diagnosis is now trivial** - can instantly see if problem is climate, governance, conflict, or alignment

## Overshoot Death Attribution Refinement (UPDATED Oct 18)

**Problem identified:** Initial implementation attributed ALL overshoot deaths to "governance" (100%). This was identified as an oversimplification after debate between super-alignment-researcher and research-skeptic agents.

**Research consensus:** IPCC AR6 (2022), Rapa Nui study (2020), Sahel 2022 analysis all show overshoot deaths result from **multi-factor interactions** between climate, poverty, and governance - NOT monocausal.

**Solution implemented:** Multi-factor proportional attribution

### Attribution Algorithm

```typescript
// Climate contribution: Capacity degradation from climate (20-60%)
climateContribution = 1.0 - climateModifier

// Resource/ecosystem contribution (climate-driven but indirect)
resourceContribution = (1.0 - resourceModifier) √ó 0.5
ecosystemContribution = (1.0 - ecosystemModifier) √ó 0.3

// Total environmental impact (capped at 70%)
environmentalImpact = min(0.7, sum of above)

// Poverty constraint: Can't afford adaptation (5-30%)
povertyConstraint = (1 - materialAbundance) √ó 0.4

// Governance: Remainder (minimum 20% floor - policy ALWAYS matters)
governanceShare = max(0.2, 1.0 - environmentalImpact - povertyConstraint)
```

### Example Scenarios

1. **Severe drought** (climateStability=0.4, abundance=0.7):
   - Climate: 50%, Poverty: 12%, Governance: 38%

2. **Policy failure with good climate** (climateStability=0.9, abundance=0.3):
   - Climate: 20%, Poverty: 28%, Governance: 52%

3. **Mixed conditions** (climateStability=0.6, abundance=0.5):
   - Climate: 40%, Poverty: 20%, Governance: 40%

### Consistency with Famine System

This matches the existing famine attribution logic (`FamineSystemPhase.ts:46-86`):
- Both use proportional multi-factor attribution
- Both recognize climate, governance, AND poverty contribute
- Both avoid monocausal oversimplification

### Research Citations

- IPCC AR6 (2022): Climate reduces African agricultural productivity 33% since 1961
- Rapa Nui study (2020, *Proceedings of the Royal Society B*): 40% climate, 60% land management
- Sahel 2022 (World Weather Attribution): <20% climate, 60-70% governance/infrastructure
- Sen's entitlement theory: Capacity is socially determined, but climate sets hard limits

## Future Work

Still need to add root cause tracking for:
- AI-caused deaths (‚Üí alignment root cause)
- War deaths (‚Üí conflict root cause)
- Tipping point cascade deaths (‚Üí climateChange or natural)

Most death sources now tracked multi-dimensionally with proportional attribution.

## Aggregate Death Statistics Feature (ADDED Oct 18, Evening)

**Problem:** Monte Carlo runs tracked individual run death statistics, but didn't aggregate across all runs. Hard to see overall patterns across 100+ simulations.

**Solution:** Added aggregate death statistics to Monte Carlo script:

### Implementation (`scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts`)

1. **Added to RunResult interface:**
   - `deathsByProximate` object (9 categories)
   - `deathsByRoot` object (7 categories)

2. **Extraction logic** (lines 1086-1093):
   - Extract `deathsByCategory` from final state
   - Extract `deathsByRootCause` from final state

3. **Storage in results** (lines 1413-1433):
   - Store detailed death breakdown for each run

4. **Aggregation logic** (lines 2707-2735):
   - Sum deaths across all runs
   - Calculate totals for proximate and root causes

5. **Display section** (lines 2750-2797):
   - Show aggregate statistics with percentages
   - Compare proximate vs root causes
   - Key insights interpretation
   - Reality check warning for discrepancies

### Example Output (N=2 test, 24 months)

```
üíÄ MULTI-DIMENSIONAL DEATH STATISTICS (Oct 18, 2025)
================================================================================

  AGGREGATE ACROSS 2 RUNS:
    Total Crisis Deaths: 967M (excluding natural deaths)
    Average per Run: 484M

  === PROXIMATE CAUSES (What killed them) ===
    Famine:     899M (93.0%)
    Disasters:  38M (4.0%)
    Disease:    9M (0.9%)
    Other:      21M (2.1%)

  === ROOT CAUSES (Why it happened) ===
    Governance:      602M (64.2%)
    Climate Change:  286M (30.5%)
    Poverty:         49M (5.2%)

  KEY INSIGHT: Multi-Factor Attribution
    64% governance root cause ‚Üí policy/distribution failures dominate
    31% climate creates stress, but systems amplify it into mass death

  ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Proximate deaths (967M) != Root deaths (938M)
      Attribution may have bugs. Check populationDynamics.ts and regionalPopulations.ts
```

### Benefits

1. **Instant diagnosis:** See dominant death causes across entire Monte Carlo suite
2. **Pattern detection:** Identify if climate, governance, or poverty drives mortality
3. **Validation:** Reality check warns if proximate/root totals diverge
4. **Research clarity:** Multi-factor attribution visible at aggregate level

### Known Issues

- Small discrepancy (3%) between proximate and root totals in test run
- Some death sources may not have complete multi-factor attribution yet
- Will validate with full N=100, 240-month run

**User reaction:** "omg this is great it will make everything infinity easier to diagnose!"

Mission accomplished. üéØ
