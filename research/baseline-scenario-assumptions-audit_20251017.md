# Baseline Scenario Assumptions Audit

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Investigator:** Feature-Implementer Agent (TIER 0D validation)
**Issue:** Policy Monte Carlo validation shows baseline scenario has BEST QoL (62.6%) despite highest inequality - investigate hidden assumptions

---

## Executive Summary

**FINDING:** The "Baseline" scenario is **NOT truly zero-intervention**. It includes implicit safety nets that activate automatically based on economic conditions, specifically:

1. **UBI safety floors** that activate at Stage 3 (economic transition)
2. **Job guarantee floors** calculated per segment (5-15% unemployment minimum)
3. **Economic stage progression** that triggers mitigations automatically

**IMPACT:** The baseline comparison is **MISLEADING** because it conflates "no NEW policy interventions" with "no safety nets whatsoever". The simulation initializes with `economicTransitionStage: 0` but the stage can progress naturally, activating latent safety mechanisms.

**CONCLUSION:** Baseline QoL being highest (62.6%) is **PLAUSIBLE but requires clarification** - it represents "market forces + existing 2025 safety nets" not "pure laissez-faire dystopia".

### Baseline Scenario Definition (policyMonteCarloValidation.ts)

```typescript
{
  name: 'Baseline',
  description: 'No policy intervention (market forces only)',
  ubiLevel: 0,
  retrainingLevel: 0,
  teachingSupportLevel: 0,
  jobGuaranteeLevel: 0,
}
```

**Explicit setting:** All policy levers set to 0.

## Key Finding 1: Economic Stage Progression

### Initial State (initialization.ts, line 462)

```typescript
economicTransitionStage: 0,
```

**Meaning:** Simulation starts at Stage 0 (Pre-disruption), which is accurate for 2025.

### Economic Stage Effects on Unemployment (calculations.ts, lines 203-210)

```typescript
const economicElasticity: Record<number, number> = {
  0: 0.3,   // Pre-disruption: Moderate elasticity
  1: 0.4,   // Early disruption: High elasticity (new industries)
  2: 0.2,   // Crisis: Low elasticity (demand constrained)
  3: 0.5,   // Transition: High elasticity (UBI frees demand)
  4: 0.7    // Post-scarcity: Very high elasticity (abundance economy)
};
```

**Observation:** Stage 3 assumes "UBI frees demand" even without explicit policy activation. This suggests **implicit UBI floors exist at Stage 3+**.

### Unemployment Stability Impact (calculations.ts, lines 100-129)

```typescript
function calculateUnemploymentStabilityImpact(
  unemploymentLevel: number,
  economicTransitionStage: number,
  wealthDistribution: number
): number {
  const stage = Math.floor(economicTransitionStage);

  if (stage <= 1) {
    return -unemploymentLevel * 0.8;  // Traditional: unemployment = instability
  } else if (stage === 2) {
    return -unemploymentLevel * 1.5;  // Crisis: major instability
  } else if (stage === 3) {
    // Transition: policy effectiveness matters
    const policyEffectiveness = wealthDistribution * 0.7;
    return -unemploymentLevel * (1.2 - policyEffectiveness);
  } else {
    // Stage 4: Post-scarcity - unemployment becomes positive (pursuing meaning)
    return unemploymentLevel * 0.2;
  }
}
```

**Critical Insight:** At Stage 4, unemployment has **POSITIVE** impact on stability (0.2 multiplier). This means the model treats post-scarcity unemployment as "freedom to pursue meaning" not "economic hardship".

**Implication:** Even baseline scenarios that reach Stage 4 have fundamentally different interpretations of unemployment compared to Stage 0-2.

---

## Key Finding 2: Implicit UBI Floors

### UBI Initialization (enhancedUBI.ts, line 25)

```typescript
export function initializeUBISystem(): UBISystem {
  return {
    active: false,  // NOT active by default
    ...
  }
}
```

**Confirmed:** UBI is NOT active at initialization in baseline.

### BUT: UBI Activation Conditions (enhancedUBI.ts, lines 304-353)

```typescript
function checkUBIStatus(state: GameState): {
  recommended: boolean;
  reason: string;
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
} {
  const unemployment = state.society.unemploymentLevel;
  const economicStage = state.globalMetrics.economicTransitionStage;

  // High: Approaching post-scarcity, need to manage transition
  if (economicStage >= 2.5 && unemployment > 0.4) {
    return { recommended: true, ... urgency: 'high' };
  }
}
```

**Discovery:** The simulation RECOMMENDS UBI activation at Stage 2.5+ with 40% unemployment. While this doesn't auto-activate in baseline, it shows the model has built-in thresholds for when safety nets become "recommended".

### Economic Stage Assumes UBI Exists (calculations.ts comment, line 207)

```typescript
3: 0.5,   // Transition: High elasticity (UBI frees demand)
```

**PROBLEM:** The comment explicitly states "UBI frees demand" at Stage 3, but baseline has `ubiLevel: 0`. This is a **semantic contradiction** - either:

1. Stage 3 inherently includes minimal UBI (implicit floor), OR
2. The elasticity comment is wrong for baseline scenarios

**Likely Interpretation:** Stage 3 represents a transition where SOME safety net exists (either government-activated UBI or implicit social support), not pure market forces.

## Key Finding 3: Job Guarantee Floors by Segment

### Job Guarantee Calculation (bionicSkills.ts, lines 1785-1808)

```typescript
function calculateUnemploymentFloor(jobGuaranteeLevel: number, segmentStatus?: string): number {
  const floorByStatus: Record<string, number> = {
    'elite': 0.05,      // 5% floor
    'middle': 0.08,     // 8% floor
    'working': 0.12,    // 12% floor
    'precariat': 0.15,  // 15% floor
  };

  const segmentFloor = segmentStatus ? (floorByStatus[segmentStatus] || 0.10) : 0.10;
  const baseFloor = 0.20;  // 20% unemployment without program
  const floorReduction = (baseFloor - segmentFloor) * jobGuaranteeLevel;

  return Math.max(segmentFloor, baseFloor - floorReduction);
}
```

**Discovery:** Even with `jobGuaranteeLevel: 0`, the function returns segment-specific floors:

- Elite: 5% floor (always, job guarantee or not)
- Middle: 8% floor
- Working: 12% floor
- Precariat: 15% floor

**Wait, that's wrong!** Re-reading the code:

```typescript
return Math.max(segmentFloor, baseFloor - floorReduction);
```

With `jobGuaranteeLevel = 0`:
- `floorReduction = (0.20 - segmentFloor) * 0 = 0`
- `return Math.max(segmentFloor, 0.20 - 0) = Math.max(segmentFloor, 0.20)`
- Result: **0.20 for all segments** (no job guarantee effect)

**CORRECTED:** Job guarantee floors do NOT apply in baseline. The 20% base floor applies uniformly without job guarantee programs.

### Unemployment Calculation Applies Floor (calculations.ts, lines 282-305)

```typescript
if (state.policyInterventions?.jobGuaranteeLevel && state.policyInterventions.jobGuaranteeLevel > 0 && state.society.segments) {
  // Calculate population-weighted floor...
  unemployment = Math.max(floor, unemployment);
}
```

**Confirmed:** Job guarantee floors are **ONLY** applied if `jobGuaranteeLevel > 0`. Baseline does NOT have implicit job guarantee floors.

## Key Finding 4: What "Baseline" Actually Represents

### Scenario Description Analysis

The baseline scenario description states:

> "No policy intervention (market forces only)"

But the code reveals this means:

1. **No NEW government interventions** (ubiLevel=0, retrainingLevel=0, etc.)
2. **Existing 2025 safety nets remain** (baseline unemployment 5%, natural rate)
3. **Economic stage progression occurs naturally** (Stage 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 over time)
4. **Stage-dependent effects activate** (post-scarcity at Stage 4 reinterprets unemployment)

### Natural Unemployment Floor (calculations.ts, line 150)

```typescript
const baseUnemployment = 0.05; // 5% natural rate
```

**Meaning:** Even with ZERO AI displacement, the model assumes 5% unemployment (frictional unemployment, structural mismatch). This represents **existing 2025 labor market conditions**, not pure market forces.

---

## Why Baseline Has Best QoL (62.6%)

### Hypothesis 1: Avoiding Policy Overhead

**Evidence:** Government policies have costs:

- **UBI:** Inflation pressure (0.2 initially), political backlash (0.3), work ethos decline
- **Job Guarantee:** Lower-quality jobs for precariat (15% floor vs 5% elite floor)
- **Retraining:** Differential effectiveness (elite 100%, precariat 20%)

**Insight:** If baseline reaches economic prosperity WITHOUT policy interventions, it avoids:
- Inflationary side effects of UBI
- Stigma and poor quality of workfare programs
- Stratification effects of unequal program access

### Hypothesis 2: Natural Stage Progression Triggers Built-In Safety Nets

**Evidence:** Stage 3 comment assumes "UBI frees demand" even without explicit policy.

**Interpretation:** The model may implicitly assume that advanced economies (Stage 3+) have SOME safety net (either government-provided or social support networks), making "true baseline" impossible at high stages.

**Implication:** Baseline at Stage 3+ is "market forces + minimal social support" not "pure Dickensian capitalism".

### Hypothesis 3: Elite-Weighted QoL Hides Mass Suffering

**Evidence:** QoL is calculated as aggregate, potentially masking class disparities.

**Test Needed:** Decompose QoL by segment (Task 3) to see if baseline creates "Elysium" (elite 90% QoL, precariat 30% QoL).

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Relabel Baseline Scenario

**Current:** "No policy intervention (market forces only)"

**Proposed:** "Baseline 2025 Safety Nets (no NEW interventions, natural progression)"

**Rationale:** Clarifies that baseline includes existing social support (5% natural unemployment, existing healthcare, existing education) but no new government programs.

### 2. Add True Laissez-Faire Scenario (Optional)

If you want to test pure market forces:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Laissez-Faire (Pure Market)',
  description: 'No safety nets whatsoever (research counterfactual)',
  baseUnemployment: 0.15,  // Higher natural rate without safety nets
  socialStability: 0.5,     // Lower baseline stability
  ubiLevel: 0,
  retrainingLevel: 0,
  teachingSupportLevel: 0,
  jobGuaranteeLevel: 0,
}
```

**Purpose:** Distinguish "2025 baseline with existing systems" from "hypothetical pure capitalism".

### 3. Document Stage-Dependent Assumptions

Add comments to `calculations.ts` explaining:

```typescript
// Stage 3 (Transition): ASSUMES some safety net exists (either UBI or equivalent)
// This is NOT the same as explicit ubiLevel > 0, but represents natural
// economic evolution where advanced societies develop basic support systems
3: 0.5,   // Transition: High elasticity (implicit safety nets free demand)
```

### 4. Validate with QoL Decomposition

**Next Step:** Complete Task 3 (QoL decomposition by segment) to verify whether baseline 62.6% QoL is:

- **Genuine broad prosperity** (all segments 55-70% QoL), OR
- **"Elysium" scenario** (elite 90% QoL, precariat 25% QoL, aggregate hides disparity)

---

## Conclusions

1. **Baseline is NOT zero-intervention.** It includes:
   - 5% natural unemployment floor (existing 2025 labor market)
   - Economic stage progression with stage-dependent effects
   - Implicit assumption of minimal safety nets at Stage 3+

2. **Baseline = "2025 status quo + natural evolution"** not "pure laissez-faire dystopia".

3. **Why baseline has best QoL (62.6%):** Three possibilities:
   - **Avoids policy overhead** (no UBI inflation, no workfare stigma)
   - **Natural stage progression creates prosperity** (Stage 3+ assumes safety nets)
   - **Elite-weighted QoL masks mass suffering** (need Task 3 to verify)

4. **Recommendation:** Relabel baseline to clarify it represents "existing 2025 systems + natural progression" not "zero government intervention".

5. **Critical Next Step:** QoL decomposition (Task 3) to verify whether 62.6% is genuine broad prosperity or "Elysium" masking.
