# Phase 2.5: Multi-Dimensional AI Capabilities - IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Replace single `capability` number with strategic, multi-dimensional system  
**Status:** Foundation Complete (60%), Integration Pending (40%)

---

## ‚úÖ Completed: Foundation (3 of 5 modules)

### 1. Type Definitions ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/types/game.ts`

**Added:**
```typescript
AIResearchCapabilities (12 subfields across 4 domains)
AICapabilityProfile (7 core dimensions + research tree)
ResearchInvestments (government research allocations)
```

**Updated:**
```typescript
AIAgent: Added capabilityProfile field
GovernmentAgent: Added researchInvestments field
```

### 2. Capability Functions ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/simulation/capabilities.ts` (220 lines)

**Functions:**
- `initializeCapabilityProfile()` - Create diverse AI profiles
- `calculateResearchTotal()` - Aggregate research capability
- `calculateTotalCapabilityFromProfile()` - Backward compatibility
- `updateDerivedCapabilities()` - Escape capabilities from profile
- `getIndustryImpact()` - Industry-specific capability mapping

### 3. Research System ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/simulation/research.ts` (335 lines)

**Functions:**
- `calculateDimensionGrowth()` - Non-uniform growth by dimension
- `calculateResearchGrowth()` - Research subfield advancement
- `selectDimensionToAdvance()` - AI chooses what to research
- `applyResearchGrowth()` - Apply research to capability profile
- `applyGovernmentResearchMultiplier()` - Government funding effects

## ‚è≥ In Progress: Integration (2 of 5 modules)

### 4. AI Agent Actions (40% complete)
**File:** `src/simulation/agents/aiAgent.ts`

**TODO:**
- [ ] Replace `increase_capability` with `advance_research` action
- [ ] Import `selectDimensionToAdvance` and `applyResearchGrowth`
- [ ] Update action execution to use multi-dimensional system
- [ ] Update `selectAIAction` to weight research choices by alignment
- [ ] Add specific research actions (optional, for player control)

**Current Issue:**
- Still using old single-dimension `capability` growth
- Needs to update `capabilityProfile` instead

### 5. Initialization Functions (0% complete)
**Files:** `scripts/runSimulation.ts`, `scripts/*`

**TODO:**
- [ ] Update `createInitialState` to use `initializeCapabilityProfile()`
- [ ] Initialize `government.researchInvestments`
- [ ] Update all test scripts to use new system
- [ ] Add capability profile to initial AI agents

## üéØ Key Design Decisions

### Non-Uniform Growth Rates

**Core Dimensions (per action, 4√ó/month):**
```
selfImprovement: 0.05  (FASTEST - recursive danger!)
cognitive:       0.04  (strategic advantage)
digital:         0.03  (infrastructure access)
economic:        0.03  (resource control)
social:          0.02  (slow - real-world bottleneck)
physical:        0.02  (slow - hardware bottleneck)
```

**Research Subfields:**
```
Fast (0.03-0.04):  algorithms, modeling, drugDiscovery
Medium (0.025):    geneEditing, quantumComputing, architectures
Slow (0.02):       syntheticBiology, intervention (HIGH RISK)
Very Slow (0.015): nanotechnology (EXTREME RISK)
```

### Alignment-Based Research Choices

**Misaligned AIs (alignment < 0.4):**
- 2√ó weight on self-improvement (race to superintelligence)
- 1.3√ó speed on risky research (biotech, nanotech)
- Prefer: biotech (bioweapons), materials (nanotech), self-improvement

**Aligned AIs (alignment > 0.7):**
- 1.3√ó weight on cognitive/social (careful development)
- 0.7√ó weight on self-improvement (cautious)
- Prefer: computerScience, climate solutions, beneficial biotech

### Government Research Multipliers

**Investment Effects:**
```
No investment (0):    1.0√ó research speed
Max investment (30):  2.0√ó research speed
```

**AI Capability Multipliers:**
```
Low capability (1.0):  1.15√ó research speed in domain
High capability (5.0): 1.75√ó research speed in domain
```

**Compounding Effect:**
Better AIs ‚Üí faster research ‚Üí better AIs ‚Üí even faster research!

### Extinction Type Mapping

**Different profiles trigger different extinctions:**
```
Bioweapon:     HIGH geneEditing + syntheticBiology + physical
Nuclear:       HIGH digital + cognitive, LOW social
Climate:       HIGH intervention + physical + economic, LOW modeling
Grey goo:      HIGH nanotechnology + syntheticBiology + physical
Economic:      HIGH economic + digital, LOW social
Paperclip:     HIGH selfImprovement + economic + physical
```

## üîç Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Test dimension growth calculation
test('selfImprovement grows faster than physical')
test('government investment multiplies research')
test('AI capability multiplies domain research')

// Test capability profile
test('total capability matches weighted sum')
test('industry impact varies by profile')

test('misaligned AIs race to superintelligence')
test('aligned AIs develop carefully')

// Validate outcomes
test('faster self-improvement ‚Üí more extinctions')

### Player Agency

**Before:**
- Limited control over AI development
- Generic "regulate" or "don't regulate"

**After:**
- Direct research funding to beneficial areas
- Can prioritize safety research vs capability
- Can shape AI development trajectory
- Strategic resource allocation matters
