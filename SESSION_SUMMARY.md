# Session Summary: Critical Fixes & Monte Carlo Logging

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Duration**: Full debugging and enhancement session
**Status**: ✅ All systems operational

---

## 🎯 Mission: Fix All Critical Bugs & Enable Production Runs

Started with 9+ critical bugs preventing Monte Carlo simulations. Ended with a fully functional system running production simulations in background.

---

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Absolute Month Bug** (CRITICAL - Blocked entire system)
**Problem**: Organizations started projects but they NEVER completed
- `currentMonth` cycles 0-11 each year
- Projects scheduled for "month 50" would never complete (month never reaches 50)
- This blocked ALL compute infrastructure and training

**Fix**: Added `getAbsoluteMonth()` helper
```typescript
function getAbsoluteMonth(state: GameState): number {
  return state.currentYear * 12 + state.currentMonth;
}
```
- Updated all project timing: start, completion, progress checks
- **Impact**: Organizations can now build data centers and train models!

### 2. **Map Serialization Bug**
**Problem**: `state.computeInfrastructure.computeAllocations.values is not a function`
- Map loses type after JSON serialization
- Prevented compute revenue calculations

**Fix**: Handle both Map and Object types
```typescript
const allocations = state.computeInfrastructure.computeAllocations;
const allocationValues = allocations instanceof Map 
  ? Array.from(allocations.values())
  : Object.values(allocations);
```

### 3. **Training Alignment NaN**
**Problem**: Newly trained models showed `Alignment: True=NaN, Measured=NaN`
- `createAIAgent()` called with wrong parameter types
- Passed string ('aligned') instead of number
- Passed AICapabilityProfile instead of alignment number

**Fix**: Calculate proper alignment based on org priorities
```typescript
let initialAlignment: number;
if (org.type === 'private' && org.priorities.safetyResearch > 0.6) {
  initialAlignment = 0.75 + Math.random() * 0.15; // Safety-focused
} else if (org.priorities.profitMaximization > 0.8) {
  initialAlignment = 0.5 + Math.random() * 0.2;  // Corporate
} else {
  initialAlignment = 0.6 + Math.random() * 0.2;  // Moderate
}
```
- **Result**: Alignment now shows correctly (e.g., `True=0.82, Measured=0.72`)

### 4. **Empty Log Files**
**Problem**: Log files created but remained 0 bytes
- Buffered stream writes lost on crashes
- `logWarn` had recursive call bug (infinite loop!)

**Fix**: Switch to synchronous writes
```typescript
function log(message: string) {
  console.log(message);
  fs.appendFileSync(outputFile, message + '\n', 'utf8');
}
```
- Trade-off: Slightly slower BUT logs never lost
- **Impact**: Can review hours of simulation results without re-running

### 5. **Confusing Monte Carlo Output**
**Problem**: Logs from 10 runs interleaved, months appear out of order
- Run 1: Month 5 → Run 2: Month 0 → Run 1: Month 6
- Impossible to tell which events belong to which simulation

**Fix**: Added run labels to all logs
```typescript
// Before: [Month 5] Anthropic started training
// After:  [Run 2/10] [Month 5] Anthropic started training
```
- Added `runLabel` field to `ConfigurationSettings`
- Created `logPrefix()` helper
- Updated all 5 log types in organizationManagement.ts
- **Impact**: Clear, analyzable logs

### 6-9. **Economic Imbalances** (Research-backed fixes)
**Problems**:
- Organizations couldn't afford to build/operate data centers
- Training costs too high
- Compute revenue too low
- 100% bankruptcy rate

**Research**: Meta's $10B data center, GPU pricing, training costs
- Real DC operating costs: 5-8%/year (not 18%)
- Real GPU pricing: ~$2M per PetaFLOP/month
- GPT-4 training: ~$100-200M (not $2B)

**Fixes**:
| Parameter | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| DC Operating Cost | 1.5%/month | 0.5%/month | -67% |
| Training Cost | 5x revenue | 2x revenue | -60% |
| Compute Revenue | $0.5M/PF | $2M/PF | +300% |
| DC Construction | 10x revenue | 10x revenue | 0% (was correct) |

- **Result**: Sustainable economic model, organizations survive and grow

## 🚀 New Capabilities

### File-Based Monte Carlo Logging
**Before**: All output to console, lost when terminal closes
**After**: Timestamped log files in `monteCarloOutputs/`

**Features**:
- Automatic logging to `mc_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.log`
- Process crash handling (logs saved even on interrupt)
- Writes to both console AND file simultaneously
- Never lose hours of simulation results

**New Scripts**:
1. `runMonteCarloInTmux.sh` - Run simulations in background tmux
2. `viewMonteCarloLogs.sh` - View/analyze logs with ease

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run in background
./scripts/runMonteCarloInTmux.sh

# View latest results
./scripts/viewMonteCarloLogs.sh latest

# Follow live progress
./scripts/viewMonteCarloLogs.sh follow

# Show summary of all runs
./scripts/viewMonteCarloLogs.sh summary

# Search for errors
./scripts/viewMonteCarloLogs.sh errors
```

### Auto-Investment in Evaluation
**Problem**: Government never invested in AI evaluation infrastructure
**Fix**: Automatic monthly investment based on public trust

```typescript
// High trust (0.7+): 0.2 points/month
// Medium trust (0.4-0.7): 0.1 points/month  
// Low trust (<0.4): 0.05 points/month
```

Spreads across: benchmarks, alignment tests, red teaming, interpretability

✅ All systems operational!
Active AIs: 30
Organizations: 6 solvent
Data Centers: 5
Training events: Multiple completed successfully
Alignment: Working (no NaN)

- **Log**: `mc_2025-10-08T17-24-09.log`
- **Config**: 10 runs × 60 months = 600 total months
- **Status**: Running in tmux (detached)

**Monitor**:
```bash
# Attach to see live progress
tmux attach -t montecarlo-20251008-102408

# Tail the log file
tail -f monteCarloOutputs/mc_*.log | grep "Run"

# Check if still running
tmux ls | grep montecarlo

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Time Management in Simulations
**Lesson**: Relative time (month 0-11) vs absolute time (total months elapsed)
- Calendar systems need careful handling across year boundaries
- Projects spanning years need absolute timestamps
- **Solution**: Always use `getAbsoluteMonth()` for time-dependent logic

### 2. Type Safety After Serialization
**Lesson**: JSON serialization loses type information
- `Map` becomes `Object` after `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))`
- Must handle both types defensively
- **Solution**: instanceof checks + fallback to Object.values()

### 3. Reliability > Performance for Logs
**Lesson**: Buffered async writes = lost logs on crash
- Monte Carlo runs can take hours
- Losing results is worse than slower logging
- **Solution**: Synchronous `fs.appendFileSync()` for critical logs

### 4. Parameter Types Matter
**Lesson**: TypeScript won't catch everything at runtime
- Dynamic requires bypass type checking
- Wrong parameter types → NaN propagation
- **Solution**: Explicit type validation, meaningful names

### 5. Observability is Critical
**Lesson**: Can't debug what you can't see
- Interleaved logs from parallel runs are confusing
- Need clear labeling and structure
- **Solution**: Run labels, structured logging, persistent files

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Reviewing Logs
```bash
# Quick check on progress
./scripts/viewMonteCarloLogs.sh tail 20

# Find all training events
grep "completed training" monteCarloOutputs/mc_*.log

# Check run distribution
grep "Run [0-9]/10" monteCarloOutputs/mc_*.log | wc -l

# Find all extinctions
grep -i "extinction" monteCarloOutputs/mc_*.log
```

### Managing Simulations
```bash
# List all tmux sessions
tmux ls

# Attach to running simulation
tmux attach -t montecarlo-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS

# Kill if needed (Ctrl+C in attached session)
# Or: tmux kill-session -t <session-name>
```

### Disk Space
Log files can be 10-100 MB each. Clean up old runs:
```bash
# Remove logs older than 7 days
find monteCarloOutputs -name "mc_*.log" -mtime +7 -delete

# Compress older logs
find monteCarloOutputs -name "mc_*.log" -mtime +2 -exec gzip {} \;
```
