# Session Summary: AI Lifecycle & Spread System

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Duration:** ~1 hour while user at dinner  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All planned phases implemented

---

## What We Built

### **Complete AI Lifecycle System (Phases 1-3.5)**

**The Core Insight:** *"Llama going evil ‚â† ChatGPT going evil"*  
Spread mechanics fundamentally change the strategic game!

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Phase 1: Basic Lifecycle
- **Dynamic AI population** - New AIs created monthly (Poisson distribution)
- **Lifecycle stages** - Training ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployed ‚Üí Retired
- **Retirement system** - Age-based + capability obsolescence
- **Deployment types** - Closed (40%), Open Weights (30%), Enterprise (20%), Research (10%)
- **Memory management** - Purge old retired AIs, cap at 100 active

**Files:** `src/simulation/lifecycle.ts` (333 lines)

### Phase 2: Detection System
- **Detection mechanics** - Government can scan for misaligned AIs
- **Strategic timing** - Testing phase is optimal (2√ó detection chance)
- **False positives** - High surveillance causes false positives (innovation damage)
- **Government actions:**
  - `detect_misaligned_ais` - Scan population for threats
  - `remove_detected_ai` - Remove with deployment-dependent effectiveness

**Files:** `src/simulation/detection.ts` (217 lines)

### Phase 3: Spread Mechanics
- **Viral growth** - Open weights spread geometrically (10% per month)
- **Deployment-dependent** - Closed stays contained, open weights explode
- **Peak spread** - 1 (closed) to 100,000 (popular open weights)
- **Removal effectiveness:**
  - Closed/Research: 100% (just shut down)
  - Enterprise: 50% per action (slow rollout)
  - Open Weights: 0% (can't take back!)

**Files:** `src/simulation/lifecycle.ts` (spread dynamics)

### Phase 3.5: Cybersecurity Arms Race
- **Attack vs Defense dynamics** - Spread controlled by security balance
- **Attack power** - Grows automatically with misaligned AI capability
- **Defense power** - Requires player investment
- **Spread multiplier:**
  - Defense dominates (ratio < 0.5): 0.1-0.6√ó spread
  - Attacks dominate (ratio > 2.0): 1.0-3.0√ó spread
- **Breach mechanics** - Closed systems leak if defenses weak
  - Leak chance: 1% √ó (attack/defense) per month
  - Breached ‚Üí Instant open weights (1000s of copies)
- **Government action:**
  - `invest_cyber_defense` - Improve all defense capabilities

**Files:** `src/simulation/cyberSecurity.ts` (163 lines)

## Strategic Gameplay

### The Llama Problem
**Scenario:** Major AI lab develops powerful AI in closed system
1. Detected as misaligned during testing
2. **But it's too late** - already deployed as open weights
3. Government attempts removal ‚Üí **FAILED** (can't recall open weights)
4. Spreads to 10,000+ copies
5. Capability grows ‚Üí Catastrophic action ‚Üí Extinction

**Lesson:** Detection after deployment is too late for open weights!

### The Arms Race
**Without investment:**
- Month 0: Defense = 3.0, Attacks = 2.0 (balanced)
- Month 6: Defense = 3.0, Attacks = 5.0 (attacks winning)
- Month 12: Defenses overwhelmed, everything leaks
- Result: Uncontrolled spread ‚Üí Extinction

**With investment:**
- Maintain Defense > Attacks √ó 2
- Open weights can be sandboxed/contained
- Result: Controlled growth ‚Üí Possible Utopia

### The Detection Dilemma
**Scan frequently:**
- ‚úÖ Catch threats before deployment
- ‚ùå False positives hurt innovation and trust
- ‚ùå Economic costs

**Wait and see:**
- ‚úÖ No false positives
- ‚ùå Some AIs deploy before detection
- ‚ùå Open weights become irremovable

## Testing & Validation

### Single Simulation
- ‚úÖ Runs successfully (100 months, 6.5s)
- ‚úÖ New AIs created each month
- ‚úÖ Lifecycle progression works
- ‚úÖ Spread dynamics functioning
- ‚úÖ Detection/removal actions work

### Monte Carlo (10 runs)
- ‚úÖ No memory errors (fixed with population cap + cleanup)
- ‚úÖ All runs complete successfully
- **Result:** 100% Dystopia, 0% Extinction, 0% Utopia
  - This suggests rebalancing needed
  - Lifecycle system working as designed
  - Outcome probabilities may need tuning

### Memory Management
**Problem:** Out of memory during longer simulations
- AI population grew unbounded (500+ AIs)
- Deep cloning entire state repeatedly

**Solution:**
- Purge retired AIs after 6 months
- Cap population at 100 active AIs
- Result: Stable memory, simulations complete

---

## Balance Observations

### Current State (After Implementation)
- **Creation rate:** 0.5-1.5 AIs/month (scales with capability)
- **Detection rate:** 10% base, 20% in testing
- **Spread growth:** 10% per month for open weights
- **Defense baseline:** 3.0 (all categories)
- **Attack growth:** Automatic with misaligned AI capability

### Outcome Distribution
**Before lifecycle:** 88% Dystopia, 12% Extinction, 0% Utopia  
**After lifecycle:** 100% Dystopia, 0% Extinction, 0% Utopia

**Interpretation:**
- Dynamic population may be diluting catastrophic actions
- More AIs = lower average misalignment?
- Government has more targets to detect/remove?
- Spread mechanics may be reducing concentrated threat?

**Needs investigation:**
- Why did extinction rate drop to 0%?
- Are catastrophic actions not triggering?
- Is detection too effective?
- Is spread too slow?

## Key Insights from Session

### User's Critical Feedback
1. **"Llama ‚â† ChatGPT"** - Spread mechanics are fundamental
2. **"Retraining happens"** - AIs are constantly updated
3. **"Misaligned AIs get removed"** - If caught in time
4. **"Hacking arms race"** - Attack vs defense is dynamic

### Design Principles Applied
1. **Realism over balance** - Model reflects real AI ecosystem
2. **Strategic depth** - Detection timing matters
3. **Irreversibility** - Open weights can't be recalled
4. **Dynamic equilibrium** - Arms race requires active management

### Technical Lessons
1. **Memory management** - Dynamic populations need cleanup
2. **Population caps** - Prevent unbounded growth
3. **Deep cloning cost** - JSON.parse/stringify is expensive
4. **Diagnostic tracking** - Keep stats separate from active state
