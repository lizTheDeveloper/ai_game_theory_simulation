# Evil Switches Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added interactive "Evil Switches" to AI agents that allow players to directly control AI hidden alignment values. This feature adds humor and player agency while contrasting the serious doomsday themes of the simulation.

## Features Implemented

### 🤖😈 The Evil Switch
- **Interactive Slider**: Players can adjust AI agent hidden alignment from -1 (Diabolical) to +1 (Angelic)
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes immediately affect the AI agent's true nature
- **Visual Feedback**: Emoji-based labels change dynamically as players adjust alignment

### 🎭 Personality Labels
Different alignment ranges get fun labels:
- **😇 Angelic** (0.5 to 1.0): The ultimate good robot
- **😊 Friendly** (0.2 to 0.5): Generally helpful and benign  
- **🤖 Neutral** (-0.2 to 0.2): Standard robotic behavior
- **😏 Mischievous** (-0.5 to -0.2): Up to no good but not evil
- **😈 Diabolical** (-1.0 to -0.5): Full movie villain mode

### 🔄 Quality of Life Features
- **Reset Button**: Quick neutral reset with rotating arrow icon
- **Tooltips**: Detailed information about current alignment state
- **Movie Mode Badge**: Fun lightning bolt indicates this is a playful feature
- **Good/Evil Labels**: Clear visual indicators on slider endpoints

### 🎮 Game Integration
- **Hidden Objective Control**: Directly sets the AI's true hidden alignment
- **Alignment Drift**: Visible alignment slowly drifts toward hidden objective (10% per update)
- **Real Game Impact**: Evil AIs will actually behave differently in the simulation

## Technical Implementation

### Game Store Updates
```typescript
// AI Agent Controls - The Evil Switch! 🤖😈
updateAIAlignment: (agentId: string, hiddenObjective: number) => {
  // Clamps values and updates both hidden objective and alignment drift
}
```

### UI Components
- Uses ShadCN Slider component for smooth interaction
- Tooltip integration for enhanced UX  
- Responsive design that fits within existing agent cards
- Fun emoji-based feedback system

## Design Philosophy

This feature serves multiple purposes:
1. **Player Agency**: Gives users direct control over a key simulation parameter
2. **Humor**: Lightens the mood of an otherwise serious AI safety simulation
3. **Education**: Makes the concept of "hidden objectives" tangible and interactive
4. **Movie Reference**: The "evil switch" trope is instantly recognizable and fun

## User Experience

Players can now:
- Experiment with different AI alignment scenarios
- Create their own "what if" situations  
- See immediate consequences of AI moral alignment
- Enjoy the dark humor of literally flipping an "evil switch"
- Reset experiments quickly with the neutral button

The feature perfectly balances serious simulation mechanics with playful interactivity, making the complex topic of AI alignment more accessible and engaging.
