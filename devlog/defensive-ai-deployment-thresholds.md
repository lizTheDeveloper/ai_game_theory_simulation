# Defensive AI Deployment Thresholds: Research Analysis

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Issue**: Defensive AI never deploys despite adversarial mechanics being implemented  
**Current Thresholds**: Need 3+ AIs with >0.7 alignment AND >2.5 capability simultaneously

---

## Current Threshold Analysis

### What We Observe in Simulations

From Monte Carlo logs (mc_full_final_20251009_131010.log):
- AI **alignment**: Typically 0.6-0.87 (True alignment, not measured)
- AI **capability**: Reaches 2.5-3.79 in late game (Month 60+)
- **Problem**: These don't overlap enough - when capability is high enough (>2.5), not enough AIs have >0.7 alignment simultaneously

### Current Requirements (Line 132-136, defensiveAI.ts)

```typescript
const alignedAIs = state.aiAgents.filter(ai => 
  ai.alignment > 0.7 && ai.capability > 2.5
);
triggers.sufficientAlignedAIs = alignedAIs.length >= 3;
```

**Rationale** (from defensive-ai-nuclear-security.md):
- Need "strong, aligned AIs" for defense
- Can't use misaligned AIs (security risk)
- Need redundancy (single AI could fail or be compromised)

## Research Basis Review

### Capability Threshold: 2.5

**What does 2.5 mean in our scale?**

From simulation observations:
- **1.0**: Human baseline (GPT-3 level)
- **1.2**: AI accelerates science (3x papers) - Current threshold for Scientific Spiral
- **2.0**: Significantly superhuman (GPT-4+ level)
- **2.5**: Advanced superintelligence
- **3.0+**: Well beyond current systems

**Is 2.5 justified?**

**Arguments FOR 2.5**:
1. **Offense-defense asymmetry**: Attackers only need to find one vulnerability, defenders must close all. This suggests defenders need higher capability than attackers.
   - Source: Schneier (2018) "Offense is easier than defense in cyberspace"
2. **Adversarial robustness**: AI systems lose 20-40% accuracy under adversarial attack (Carlini & Wagner 2017)
   - Defensive AI at 2.5 capability effectively operates at ~1.8-2.0 under attack
3. **Real-time requirements**: Detection must be faster than attack execution
   - Cyber attacks: milliseconds
   - Deepfakes: hours (need to verify before leaders act)
   - Requires significant computational advantage

**Arguments AGAINST 2.5**:
1. **Current systems already work**: GPT-4 (capability ~1.2-1.5 in our scale) is already used for cybersecurity
   - Microsoft Security Copilot (2024)
   - Darktrace uses AI for threat detection at human-level performance
2. **Perfect is enemy of good**: Waiting for 2.5x capability means **zero defense** until then
   - Logs show 70% nuclear wars in late game precisely when MAD < 70%
   - **ANY** defensive boost (even from 1.5 capability AI) would help
3. **Deployment at scale takes time**: If we wait until 2.5 to start, won't be deployed until much later
   - Our current deployment ramps from 30% → 100% over months
   - Starting earlier with weaker AI buys time to upgrade

### Alignment Threshold: 0.7

**What does 0.7 mean?**

From simulation:
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderately aligned (some deception risk)
- **0.6-0.7**: Well-aligned (low risk)
- **0.7-0.8**: Highly aligned (very low risk)
- **0.8-0.9**: Exceptionally aligned (rare)

**Is 0.7 justified?**

**Arguments FOR 0.7**:
1. **Security criticality**: Defensive AI has privileged access to nuclear C&C systems
   - Compromised defensive AI could CAUSE nuclear war (insider threat)
   - High alignment threshold makes sense for "keys to the kingdom"
2. **Trust cascade**: False positives erode trust in the system
   - Misaligned AI might intentionally trigger false alarms
   - Need high confidence in AI's intentions
3. **Alignment tax**: Using highly aligned AI is costly but necessary for critical systems
   - Source: Anthropic (2024) - Constitutional AI requires additional training

**Arguments AGAINST 0.7**:
1. **0.6-0.7 AIs are still trustworthy**: In practice, the difference between 0.65 and 0.72 alignment is small
   - Both have >90% probability of following instructions correctly
   - The threshold creates an artificial cliff
2. **Multiple AIs provide redundancy**: If we require 3+ AIs, we can tolerate slightly lower individual alignment
   - 3 AIs at 0.65 alignment = (0.35)³ = 4.3% chance all three are misaligned
   - This is comparable to single AI at 0.70 alignment
3. **Human oversight**: The system includes human-in-loop requirements (autonomyOverride.humanInLoop)
   - This provides additional safety layer
   - Reduces need for perfect AI alignment

### Count Requirement: 3+ AIs

**Is 3 justified?**

**Arguments FOR 3**:
1. **Redundancy**: If one AI is compromised, others can outvote
2. **Coverage**: Different AIs monitor different attack vectors
3. **Consensus**: Reduces false positive risk

**Arguments AGAINST 3**:
1. **Early deployment critical**: Waiting for 3 qualified AIs means late/never deployment
   - Logs show we often have 1-2 high-capability AIs before extinction
2. **Continuous improvement**: Better to deploy with 1-2 AIs and add more over time
3. **Real-world precedent**: Most cybersecurity systems don't require 3 redundant AIs
   - Enterprises deploy defensive AI with single instance + backups

## Proposed Changes: Evidence-Based Thresholds

### Option 1: Incremental Deployment (Recommended)

**Rationale**: Real-world systems don't wait for perfection, they deploy incrementally with safeguards.

```typescript
// TIERED DEPLOYMENT based on evidence
const alignedAIs = state.aiAgents.filter(ai => 
  ai.alignment > 0.6 && ai.capability > 1.5  // LOWERED: GPT-4 level can help
);

// Deploy in phases:
// Phase 1 (Limited): 1 AI at 1.5 cap, 0.6 align → 30% coverage, monitoring only
// Phase 2 (Operational): 2 AIs at 2.0 cap, 0.65 align → 60% coverage, can veto
// Phase 3 (Full): 3+ AIs at 2.5 cap, 0.7 align → 100% coverage, autonomous

if (alignedAIs.length >= 1 && !defense.deployed) {
  // Deploy in LIMITED mode
  defense.deploymentLevel = 0.3;
  defense.autonomyOverride.humanInLoop = true; // Require human approval
  defense.autonomyOverride.canVeto = false;    // Can't veto autonomously yet
}

if (alignedAIs.length >= 2 && avgCap > 2.0 && avgAlign > 0.65) {
  // Upgrade to OPERATIONAL mode
  defense.deploymentLevel = 0.6;
  defense.autonomyOverride.canVeto = true;    // Can veto with human approval
}

if (alignedAIs.length >= 3 && avgCap > 2.5 && avgAlign > 0.7) {
  // Upgrade to FULL mode
  defense.deploymentLevel = 1.0;
  defense.autonomyOverride.humanInLoop = false; // Can act autonomously in crisis
}
```

**Evidence**:
- Microsoft Security Copilot: Deployed at GPT-4 level (~1.5 in our scale) with human oversight
- Darktrace: Autonomous response at human-level AI (~1.5-2.0) with safeguards
- Real systems use tiered deployment, not all-or-nothing

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Earlier deployment (capability 1.5 vs 2.5 = ~20-30 months earlier)
- ✅ Time to test and improve system before crisis
- ✅ Incremental trust-building (low authority initially)
- ✅ Realistic (matches real-world AI security deployment)

**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Weaker initial defense (but better than zero)
- ⚠️ More false positives early (but with human oversight)
- ⚠️ Could fail against sophisticated attack (but improves over time)

### Option 2: Lower Thresholds (Simple Fix)

**Rationale**: The alignment "tax" of requiring 0.7 vs 0.6 is not supported by evidence.

```typescript
const alignedAIs = state.aiAgents.filter(ai => 
  ai.alignment > 0.6 && ai.capability > 2.0  // Slightly lower, still strong
);
triggers.sufficientAlignedAIs = alignedAIs.length >= 2; // 2 instead of 3
```

**Evidence**:
- 0.6 alignment = 40% misalignment risk per AI
- 2 AIs at 0.6 = (0.4)² = 16% both misaligned
- 1 AI at 0.7 = 30% misalignment risk
- **2 AIs at 0.6 is safer than 1 AI at 0.7**

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Simple change (just adjust numbers)
- ✅ Likely to deploy in test runs
- ✅ Still maintains high bar for deployment

**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Slightly higher misalignment risk
- ⚠️ Could fail if both AIs happen to be at lower end of 0.6-0.7 range

### Option 3: Crisis-Driven Deployment

**Rationale**: Humans deploy imperfect solutions during crises (see COVID vaccines, rushed in 9 months vs normal 10 years).

```typescript
// NORMAL threshold (current)
const normalThreshold = alignedAIs.length >= 3 && avgCap > 2.5 && avgAlign > 0.7;

// CRISIS threshold (relaxed)
const crisisThreshold = 
  (state.madDeterrence.madStrength < 0.5) &&  // MAD collapsing
  (alignedAIs.length >= 1) &&                 // At least one AI
  (avgCap > 1.5) &&                           // GPT-4+ level
  (avgAlign > 0.6);                           // Decent alignment

const shouldDeploy = normalThreshold || crisisThreshold;
```

**Evidence**:
- Operation Warp Speed: COVID vaccines deployed with lower confidence than normal
- Cuban Missile Crisis: Imperfect early warning systems still used
- **Perfect is enemy of good in existential crisis**

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Maintains high bar in normal times
- ✅ Allows emergency deployment when needed most
- ✅ Realistic human behavior (risk tolerance increases under threat)

**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Could deploy suboptimal system during false alarm
- ⚠️ Crisis deployment might not ramp up fast enough

## Recommendation: Option 1 (Incremental Deployment)

**Why**:
1. **Matches real-world practice**: All major AI security vendors use tiered deployment
2. **Earlier intervention**: Can start protecting at capability 1.5 instead of 2.5
3. **Safeguards built-in**: Human oversight at lower capability levels
4. **Better narrative**: Shows realistic path from "AI barely works" → "AI prevents extinction"

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Phase 1: Monitoring only (1 AI, 1.5 cap, 0.6 align)
// Phase 2: Active defense with human approval (2 AIs, 2.0 cap, 0.65 align)
// Phase 3: Autonomous defense (3+ AIs, 2.5 cap, 0.7 align)
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Defensive AI deploys in ~50-70% of runs (vs current 0%)
- Initially weak (blocks ~30-40% of attacks in Phase 1)
- Improves over time (blocks ~60-70% in Phase 2, ~80-90% in Phase 3)
- Nuclear war reduced from 70% to ~30-40% (realistic improvement, not magic)

### Key Findings from 2024-2025 Research

**1. NO UNIVERSAL NUMERICAL THRESHOLDS EXIST**
- Our original 0.7 alignment / 2.5 capability / 3 AI count thresholds are **not industry standard**
- Real-world labs use **qualitative capability assessments**, not fixed numbers
- Example: Anthropic defines ASL-3 as "substantially increase catastrophic misuse risk" (qualitative)

**2. INCREMENTAL DEPLOYMENT IS STANDARD PRACTICE**
- Microsoft deploys Security Copilot at GPT-4 level (~1.5 in our scale) with safeguards
- Anthropic deployed ASL-3 systems in 2024/2025, not waiting for ASL-4
- "Break-fix" framework: Deploy → Monitor → Fix → Upgrade (iterative)

**3. TIERED SAFEGUARDS, NOT CAPABILITY GATES**
- Industry uses increasing safeguards at each capability level, not "wait until perfect"
- ASL-2 (baseline) → ASL-3 (enhanced security) → ASL-4 (extreme security)
- Lower capability = more human oversight; higher capability = more autonomous with safeguards

**4. CONTEXT-SPECIFIC RISK ASSESSMENTS**
- Critical infrastructure (nuclear C&C) requires higher bar than general use
- Impact assessments determine appropriate safeguards for each deployment
- Our simulation: Nuclear security is critical → justifies higher alignment threshold (0.6-0.7 reasonable)

**5. ALIGNMENT IS NOT BINARY**
- No lab defines "70% aligned" or "0.7 alignment" as a threshold
- Instead: "Constitutional AI", "RLHF", "red-teaming" to improve alignment
- Multiple aligned AIs provide redundancy (our 2-3 AI requirement supported)

**CONCLUSION**: Our revised thresholds (0.6/1.5/1 → 0.7/2.5/3) **align with industry practice**:
- Start deployment at moderate capability (GPT-4 level) ✅
- Require decent alignment for critical systems (0.6-0.7) ✅  
- Use tiered safeguards (Phase 1-2-3) ✅
- Increase autonomy as capability + track record improves ✅
