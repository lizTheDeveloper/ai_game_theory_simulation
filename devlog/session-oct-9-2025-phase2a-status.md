# Phase 2A Breakthrough Technologies - Status Update

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented, üêõ Debugging

## What We Built

### ‚úÖ Complete Implementation (750+ lines)

1. **11 Technologies across 3 categories:**
   - Environmental: Clean Energy, Recycling, Carbon Capture, Ecosystem Management, Sustainable Agriculture, Fusion Power
   - Social: Mental Health AI, Purpose Frameworks, Community Platforms
   - Medical: Disease Elimination, Longevity Therapies

2. **Full Tech Tree System:**
   - Prerequisites and dependencies
   - Research progress tracking (0-1)
   - Deployment levels (0-1)
   - Cost and time requirements

3. **Crisis Recovery Mechanics:**
   - Technologies can REVERSE active crises
   - Pollution, Climate, Ecosystem, Meaning crises can be resolved
   - QoL improvements from deployed tech

4. **Integration Points:**
   - `src/types/technologies.ts` - Type definitions
   - `src/simulation/breakthroughTechnologies.ts` - Core system (750 lines)
   - `src/simulation/initialization.ts` - State init
   - `src/simulation/engine.ts` - Monthly updates
   - `src/simulation/environmental.ts` - Resource efficiency
   - `src/simulation/qualityOfLife.ts` - QoL boosts

## üêõ Current Issue

**Problem:** Technologies not unlocking in simulations

**Root Cause:** Research budget is $0B - government not allocating any research investment

**Debug Trail:**
1. Added auto-allocation function - should give $10B at start
2. Function appears to not be called by engine
3. Console.log debug messages not appearing in output
4. Even with `logLevel: 'summary'`, no tech system logs

**Hypothesis:** The `updateBreakthroughTechnologies()` call in `engine.ts` may not be in the actual execution path, OR there's an issue with how it's being imported/called.

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `src/types/technologies.ts` (new, 83 lines)
- ‚úÖ `src/simulation/breakthroughTechnologies.ts` (new, 774 lines)
- ‚úÖ `src/types/game.ts` (added breakthroughTech field)
- ‚úÖ `src/simulation/initialization.ts` (added init call)
- ‚úÖ `src/simulation/engine.ts` (added update calls)
- ‚úÖ `src/simulation/environmental.ts` (added efficiency multiplier)
- ‚úÖ `src/simulation/qualityOfLife.ts` (added tech boosts)
- ‚úÖ `scripts/testBreakthroughTech.ts` (new test script)
- ‚úÖ `devlog/breakthrough-technologies-phase-2a.md` (documentation)

## Next Steps

1. **Verify engine integration** - Check if `updateBreakthroughTechnologies` is actually being called
2. **Fix research budget** - Either fix auto-allocation or set non-zero defaults
3. **Test unlocks** - Once budget allocated, verify technologies unlock at expected times
4. **Test crisis recovery** - Trigger crises, deploy tech, verify resolution
5. **Monte Carlo validation** - Run 10+ sims, measure Utopia rate (target: 10-15%)

## Expected Behavior Once Fixed

### Technology Unlock Timeline (with $10B budget):
- **Month 15-20:** Sustainable Agriculture, Community Platforms
- **Month 20-30:** Clean Energy, Mental Health AI, Disease Elimination
- **Month 30-40:** Advanced Recycling, Purpose Frameworks
- **Month 40-50:** Carbon Capture, Ecosystem Management
- **Month 50+:** Fusion Power, Longevity Therapies

### Crisis Recovery Example:
```
Month 22: Ecosystem Collapse triggered (biodiversity 28%)
Month 30: Clean Energy unlocks (with investment starting Month 1)
Month 40: Ecosystem Management unlocks
Month 42: Biodiversity recovering (+2%/month)
Month 50: Biodiversity > 60%, crisis RESOLVES ‚úÖ
Month 60: Golden Age restored, path to Utopia open
```

## Technical Notes

### Research Budget Calculation:
```typescript
// From government research investments:
environmentalBudget = 
  climate.mitigation + 
  climate.intervention + 
  materials.energySystems + 
  (physical * 0.3)

// Should be ~$4B at Stage 0, ~$8B at Stage 3
```

### Auto-Allocation (temporary):
```typescript
// Should run each month if budget differs from target
targetBudget = 10 + economicStage * 5  // $10-30B
// Splits: 40% env, 30% social, 30% medical
```

## Commits Ready

All code is implemented and ready to commit once debugging complete. No breaking changes to existing systems.

## Test Results

- ‚úÖ Code compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ Type checking passes
- ‚ùå Technologies not unlocking (research budget issue)
- ‚è≥ Monte Carlo test in progress (3 runs, 60 months)

---

**Bottom Line:** System is fully built and should work. Just need to fix the research budget allocation or verify the engine integration. Once that's resolved, we should see technologies unlocking and providing recovery pathways.
