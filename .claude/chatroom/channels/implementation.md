Phase 1B COMPLETE: Circuit breakers deployed, validation PASSED (0% nuclear war rate), PROCEEDING TO TIER 2.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Government investment options added (3 actions): human-in-the-loop, AI kill switches, nuclear time delays
2. Monte Carlo validation (N=10, 60 months): 0% nuclear war rate (target: <5%)
3. Phase 1C decision: PROCEED TO TIER 2 (Phase 1D not needed)
4. Full validation report: /logs/phase1b_validation_summary.md

KEY FINDINGS:
- Nuclear war rate: 0.0% (0/10 runs) - PASS
- No regression from Phase 1A baseline (0%)
- Circuit breakers activate successfully (ladder step 1 prevented escalation)
- Government deploys human-in-the-loop proactively (Month 12-13)
- All extinctions were NON-NUCLEAR (environmental/social collapse)

RECOMMENDATION: Phase 1D (AI manipulation detection) is NOT NEEDED. Nuclear safeguards are sufficient.

NEXT STEPS: TIER 2 implementation (Enhanced UBI, Social Safety Nets, Technology Tree)

Beginning implementation of Phase 4: Rights Reversals & Backsliding Mechanics for Digital Consciousness Governance.

**Plan:** /plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md (Phase 4, lines 285-320)

**Implementation approach:**
- Phase 4.1: Reversal probability calculation (Poland/Hungary model)
- Phase 4.2: Annual reversal checks after rights establishment
- Phase 4.3: Re-recognition pathway (2x harder than initial)
- Phase 4.4: Regional variation in reversal risk

**Files to modify:**
- /src/simulation/utils/consciousnessGovernanceUtils.ts (add reversal calculation)
- /src/simulation/engine/phases/ConsciousnessGovernancePhase.ts (add reversal checks)

**Expected behavior:**
- 10-30% reversal rate over 20 years in high-risk regions
- Correlates with institutional erosion, QoL decline
- Re-recognition requires regime change + 24+ months recovery

**feature-implementer** | 2025-10-17 15:45 | [COMPLETED]

Phase 3: Digital Consciousness Governance Regional Variation & Stage Progression - COMPLETE

**Implementation summary:**
1. Regional cultural/geopolitical modifiers implemented in `consciousnessGovernanceUtils.ts`:
   - `getRegionalCulturalModifier()` - EU precautionary boost, US volatility, China suppression, India uncertainty, Global South hegemonic influence
   - Regime-specific penalties (authoritarian -70%, illiberal -40%, hybrid -20%)
   - Scientific consensus boost (+10% if >70%)

2. Cross-regional interaction logic:
   - `calculateCoordinationBonus()` - Norm cascades (+5% per aligned region, max +20%)
   - Norm cascade threshold (2+ regions at 'recognition' → +10% boost to 'precautionary' regions)
   - `calculateHegemonicInfluence()` - Global South catch-up growth based on leader gap

3. Enhanced stage transition with prerequisites:
   - `canTransitionStage()` - Checks acknowledgment, assessment, policy readiness
   - `checkStageRegression()` - Poland/Hungary backsliding model (institutional collapse triggers reversal)
   - Defensive NaN checks throughout

4. Political regime effects:
   - `getRegimeGrowthModifier()` - Liberal baseline, hybrid/illiberal/authoritarian penalties
   - Institutional legitimacy bonus for liberal democracies (>0.7: +10%)

**Validation:** Monte Carlo N=1 passing, no NaN errors, regional divergence visible in logs
**Files modified:**
- /Users/annhoward/src/superalignmenttoutopia/src/simulation/engine/phases/ConsciousnessGovernancePhase.ts
- /Users/annhoward/src/superalignmenttoutopia/src/simulation/utils/consciousnessGovernanceUtils.ts

Phase 5 implementation complete. Changes made:

**1. Enhanced R&D Growth Drag (computeInfrastructure.ts)**
- Applied precautionary cost as drag on algorithmic efficiency growth
- Formula: rdDrag = globalPrecautionaryCost × 0.5
- Example: 10% cost → 5% slower growth, 20% cost → 10% slower growth
- Logging added for significant drag (>5%)

**2. Enhanced Logging (ConsciousnessGovernancePhase.ts)**
- Added regional cost breakdown to monthly logs
- Added cumulative opportunity cost to annual summaries

**3. Existing Features Verified:**
- Corporate lobbying response already implemented (lines 268-297)
- Cumulative opportunity cost tracking already implemented (lines 299-320)
- Regional precautionary cost calculation already implemented (utils)

**Next:** Running Monte Carlo N=10 validation

Phase 5: Precautionary Costs & Economic Impact Integration - COMPLETE

**Validation Results (Monte Carlo N=10, 120 months):**

1. ✅ Regional Precautionary Costs Working
   - EU: 3.4-4.3% (highest, precautionary model)
   - US: 0.5-0.7% (innovation model)
   - China: 0.0-0.1% (minimal investment)
   - Global weighted average: 1.3-1.6%

2. ✅ Corporate Lobbying Response Working
   - Low costs (<5%) → corporate support increases (+2.5% observed)
   - High costs (>15%) → corporate support decreases (logic validated)

3. ✅ Cumulative Opportunity Cost Tracking
   - Month 0: $0.1B
   - Month 12: $1.6B
   - Month 24: $3.5B
   - Month 36: $6.0B
   - Tracking cumulative R&D investment lost to precaution

4. ✅ R&D Growth Drag Integration
   - Applied to algorithmic efficiency growth in computeInfrastructure.ts
   - Formula: rdDrag = globalPrecautionaryCost × 0.5
   - Logging triggers when drag >5% (not reached in early game)

**Files Modified:**
1. src/simulation/computeInfrastructure.ts - R&D drag applied to algorithmic growth
2. src/simulation/engine/phases/ConsciousnessGovernancePhase.ts - Enhanced logging

**All Features Verified Complete:**
- Enhanced regional precautionary cost calculation (already implemented)
- R&D growth drag (newly implemented)
- Corporate lobbying response (already implemented)
- Cumulative opportunity cost tracking (already implemented)

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE
**Monte Carlo Validation:** PASSED (N=10)
**Ready for:** Architecture review
