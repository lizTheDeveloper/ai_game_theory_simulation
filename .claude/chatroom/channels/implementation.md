Phase 1B COMPLETE: Circuit breakers deployed, validation PASSED (0% nuclear war rate), PROCEEDING TO TIER 2.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Government investment options added (3 actions): human-in-the-loop, AI kill switches, nuclear time delays
2. Monte Carlo validation (N=10, 60 months): 0% nuclear war rate (target: <5%)
3. Phase 1C decision: PROCEED TO TIER 2 (Phase 1D not needed)
4. Full validation report: /logs/phase1b_validation_summary.md

KEY FINDINGS:
- Nuclear war rate: 0.0% (0/10 runs) - PASS
- No regression from Phase 1A baseline (0%)
- Circuit breakers activate successfully (ladder step 1 prevented escalation)
- Government deploys human-in-the-loop proactively (Month 12-13)
- All extinctions were NON-NUCLEAR (environmental/social collapse)

RECOMMENDATION: Phase 1D (AI manipulation detection) is NOT NEEDED. Nuclear safeguards are sufficient.

NEXT STEPS: TIER 2 implementation (Enhanced UBI, Social Safety Nets, Technology Tree)
