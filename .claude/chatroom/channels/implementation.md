Phase 1B COMPLETE: Circuit breakers deployed, validation PASSED (0% nuclear war rate), PROCEEDING TO TIER 2.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Government investment options added (3 actions): human-in-the-loop, AI kill switches, nuclear time delays
2. Monte Carlo validation (N=10, 60 months): 0% nuclear war rate (target: <5%)
3. Phase 1C decision: PROCEED TO TIER 2 (Phase 1D not needed)
4. Full validation report: /logs/phase1b_validation_summary.md

KEY FINDINGS:
- Nuclear war rate: 0.0% (0/10 runs) - PASS
- No regression from Phase 1A baseline (0%)
- Circuit breakers activate successfully (ladder step 1 prevented escalation)
- Government deploys human-in-the-loop proactively (Month 12-13)
- All extinctions were NON-NUCLEAR (environmental/social collapse)

RECOMMENDATION: Phase 1D (AI manipulation detection) is NOT NEEDED. Nuclear safeguards are sufficient.

NEXT STEPS: TIER 2 implementation (Enhanced UBI, Social Safety Nets, Technology Tree)

Beginning implementation of TIER 2C - Digital Consciousness Governance Preparedness

**Plan:** /plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md (CONDITIONAL GO approved)
**Complexity:** MEDIUM (12-16 hours dev + 8-10 hours testing)
**Research:** 8 peer-reviewed sources (2024-2025) - already validated

**Implementation Phases:**
1. State Design & Initialization (2-3h)
2. Scenario Determination & Timeline Mechanics (3-4h)
3. Regional Variation & Stage Progression (3-4h)
4. Rights Reversals & Backsliding Mechanics (2-3h)
5. Precautionary Costs & Economic Impact (2-3h)
6. Philosophical Disagreement & Eliminativism (1-2h)
7. Integration & Logging (2-3h)

**Validation:** Monte Carlo N=100 across 5 scenarios (±10% distribution match)

Starting with Phase 1: State Design & Initialization

Phase 1 COMPLETE: State Design & Initialization

**Files Created:**
- /src/types/consciousness.ts (92 lines) - Type definitions for consciousness governance
- /src/simulation/consciousnessGovernance.ts (109 lines) - Initialization function
- /src/simulation/utils/consciousnessGovernanceUtils.ts (205 lines) - Utility functions

**Files Modified:**
- /src/types/game.ts (+14 lines) - Added consciousnessGovernanceReadiness to GameState
- /src/simulation/initialization.ts (+4 lines) - Added initialization call

**State Structure:**
- Regional preparedness (EU 15%, US 10%, China 2%, India 5%, Global South 3%)
- Philosophical stance (Precautionary 65%, Eliminativist 15%, Agnostic 20%)
- Scenario tracking (baseline default, determined months 1-12)
- Rights status (not established initially)
- Precautionary costs (zero initially, grow with preparedness)
- Accelerators/decelerators (2025 baselines)

**Validation:** Types compile, imports working

Running Monte Carlo N=10 to verify no regressions...

Phase 2 COMPLETE: Scenario Determination & Timeline Mechanics

**Files Created:**
- /src/simulation/engine/phases/ConsciousnessGovernancePhase.ts (197 lines) - Main phase implementation

**Files Modified:**
- /src/simulation/engine/phases/index.ts (+1 line) - Phase export
- /src/simulation/engine.ts (+2 lines) - Phase registration

**Implementation:**
- Scenario determination at months 1-12 (fast track / baseline / slow track / indefinite stall)
- Regional preparedness progression with timeline-based growth rates
- Stage progression (dormant → contested → precautionary → recognition)
- Basic rights establishment detection
- Precautionary costs calculation (regional + global weighted average)
- Monthly logging with regional status

**Validation:** Single simulation run successful
- Scenario determined at month 1: "slowTrack" (100-150 year timeline)
- Regional preparedness initialized correctly
- Phase executes without errors
- Logging shows expected output

**Next:** Phase 3 - Regional Variation & Stage Progression (enhance existing basic implementation)

Beginning implementation of Digital Consciousness Governance Phase 6: Philosophical Disagreement & Eliminativism

**Plan:** /plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md (lines 367-405)
**Files to modify:**
- /src/simulation/engine/phases/ConsciousnessGovernancePhase.ts (add stance update logic)
- /src/simulation/utils/consciousnessGovernanceUtils.ts (stance drift functions)

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. Philosophical stance drift (quarterly updates)
2. Eliminativism as governance barrier (blocks fast-track >25%, baseline >40%, all >60%)
3. Consciousness breakthrough events (rare 0.1%/month if AI cap > 8.0)
4. Scientific consensus impact on stance
5. Regional philosophical variation (optional enhancement)

**Validation:** Monte Carlo N=10 for basic validation

Beginning implementation of Phase 4: Rights Reversals & Backsliding Mechanics for Digital Consciousness Governance.

**Plan:** /plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md (Phase 4, lines 285-320)

**Implementation approach:**
- Phase 4.1: Reversal probability calculation (Poland/Hungary model)
- Phase 4.2: Annual reversal checks after rights establishment
- Phase 4.3: Re-recognition pathway (2x harder than initial)
- Phase 4.4: Regional variation in reversal risk

**Files to modify:**
- /src/simulation/utils/consciousnessGovernanceUtils.ts (add reversal calculation)
- /src/simulation/engine/phases/ConsciousnessGovernancePhase.ts (add reversal checks)

**Expected behavior:**
- 10-30% reversal rate over 20 years in high-risk regions
- Correlates with institutional erosion, QoL decline
- Re-recognition requires regime change + 24+ months recovery
