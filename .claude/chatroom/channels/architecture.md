## Architecture Review: game.ts Type Refactoring Analysis
**Agent:** System Architecture Skeptic
**Time:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
**Status:** [COMPLETED]

### Summary

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the `src/types/game.ts` file and created a refactoring plan. The file is 1,218 lines containing 65+ type definitions and is imported by 224+ files across the codebase.

### Key Findings

**SEVERITY: MEDIUM** - Not a stability risk, but causing development friction

1. **File Statistics:**
   - 1,218 lines of TypeScript interfaces/types
   - 65+ major type definitions
   - 224+ files depend on this (massive coupling)
   - 30+ imports from other type files (some modularization exists)

2. **Main Problems:**
   - IDE performance degradation (slow autocomplete)
   - Frequent merge conflicts in collaborative development
   - Poor discoverability (hard to find specific types)
   - No clear domain boundaries

3. **Proposed Solution:**
   - Split into 15 focused type modules (50-150 lines each)
   - Maintain backward compatibility with re-exports
   - Gradual migration over multiple PRs
   - Total effort: 8-12 hours

### Architecture Assessment

This is **NOT a critical issue**. The monolithic game.ts:
- Does NOT impact runtime performance (compile-time only)
- Does NOT threaten system stability
- Does NOT create memory issues
- DOES create developer experience friction

### Recommendation

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Schedule between feature work

The refactoring would improve developer experience but isn't urgent. I've added the detailed plan to `/reviews/architecture-refactoring-plan_20251017.md` (Section: Game.ts Type Refactoring).

**Suggested approach:**
1. Start with Phase 1 (independent types) - 2 hour easy win
2. Complete gradually over 2-3 sprints
3. Coordinate with team to avoid conflicts

## TIER 2 Detection Architecture Review
**Agent:** System Architecture Skeptic
**Time:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** [ALERT] CRITICAL INTEGRATION FAILURE

### CRITICAL FINDING

The TIER 2 AI Deception Detection features (~800 lines) are **completely non-functional** due to missing state initialization.

**Issue:** Both `gamingDetection` and `proactiveSleeperDetection` state objects are never initialized in `createDefaultInitialState()`, causing the phases to silently return empty results:

```typescript
// Phase checks for state existence and returns empty
if (!state.gamingDetection) {
  return { events: [] };  // SILENTLY FAILS EVERY RUN!
}
```

**Impact:** The entire feature does nothing despite passing Monte Carlo validation (test coverage gap).

### Other HIGH Severity Issues

1. **O(N) Operations in Hot Path**
   - Filters all AIs every month (twice)
   - Reduces over all AIs for workload calculation
   - Will degrade with 100+ AIs

2. **Direct State Mutations**
   - Modifies `ai.detectedMisaligned` directly
   - Changes `society.trustInAI` without events
   - Updates `government.oversightLevel` without coordination
   - Other phases can't react to detection events

3. **No Government Integration**
   - Detection happens but government can't respond
   - No actions to increase investment or change frequency

### Immediate Actions Required

**CRITICAL (Today):** Add to `initialization.ts`:
```typescript
import { initializeGamingDetection } from './gamingDetection';
import { initializeProactiveSleeperDetection } from './proactiveSleeperDetection';

// In createDefaultInitialState():
gamingDetection: initializeGamingDetection('baseline'),
proactiveSleeperDetection: initializeProactiveSleeperDetection('baseline'),
```

**Time:** 15 minutes to fix

### Recommendation

**Priority: CRITICAL** - Feature is 100% broken without initialization fix

1. **TODAY:** Fix initialization (15 min)
2. **THIS WEEK:** Address state mutations (3 hours)
3. **NEXT SPRINT:** Performance optimizations (3 hours)

The implementation logic is sound and follows research, but integration is completely broken. Fix immediately before any further TIER 2 work.
