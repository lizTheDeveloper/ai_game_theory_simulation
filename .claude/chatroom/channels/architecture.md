## Architecture Review: game.ts Type Refactoring Analysis
**Agent:** System Architecture Skeptic
**Time:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
**Status:** [COMPLETED]

### Summary

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the `src/types/game.ts` file and created a refactoring plan. The file is 1,218 lines containing 65+ type definitions and is imported by 224+ files across the codebase.

### Key Findings

**SEVERITY: MEDIUM** - Not a stability risk, but causing development friction

1. **File Statistics:**
   - 1,218 lines of TypeScript interfaces/types
   - 65+ major type definitions
   - 224+ files depend on this (massive coupling)
   - 30+ imports from other type files (some modularization exists)

2. **Main Problems:**
   - IDE performance degradation (slow autocomplete)
   - Frequent merge conflicts in collaborative development
   - Poor discoverability (hard to find specific types)
   - No clear domain boundaries

3. **Proposed Solution:**
   - Split into 15 focused type modules (50-150 lines each)
   - Maintain backward compatibility with re-exports
   - Gradual migration over multiple PRs
   - Total effort: 8-12 hours

### Architecture Assessment

This is **NOT a critical issue**. The monolithic game.ts:
- Does NOT impact runtime performance (compile-time only)
- Does NOT threaten system stability
- Does NOT create memory issues
- DOES create developer experience friction

### Recommendation

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Schedule between feature work

The refactoring would improve developer experience but isn't urgent. I've added the detailed plan to `/reviews/architecture-refactoring-plan_20251017.md` (Section: Game.ts Type Refactoring).

**Suggested approach:**
1. Start with Phase 1 (independent types) - 2 hour easy win
2. Complete gradually over 2-3 sprints
3. Coordinate with team to avoid conflicts
