Beginning TIER 2 Phase 2A: Single Detection Method - Noise Injection

**Feature:** AI deception detection adversarial validation (CRITICAL VALIDATION GATE)
**Complexity:** MEDIUM-HIGH (6 steps, 4-6 hours)
**Priority:** CRITICAL (determines path: >10% → ensemble, <5% → pivot to competitive equilibrium)

**Context:**
- Infrastructure COMPLETE: Gaming detection + Proactive sleeper detection (Oct 17)
- Research-skeptic warning: Lab detection ≠ adversarial deployment (1/3 to 1/10 effectiveness)
- Outcome determines roadmap: >10% detection → ensemble methods (33-55h), <5% → pivot to competitive equilibrium (30-50h)

**Implementation Plan (6 Steps):**
1. Read existing infrastructure (gamingDetection.ts 11,645 lines, proactiveSleeperDetection.ts 14,469 lines, detection.ts 7,327 lines) - 2h
2. Design noise injection detection (Meinke et al. 2024 parameters) - 1h
3. Implement detection method (add to gamingDetection.ts, integrate with BenchmarkEvaluationsPhase.ts) - 2-3h
4. Add adversarial testing setup (AIs optimize to pass detection, not just hide capabilities) - 1h
5. Run adversarial Monte Carlo N=20, 120 months - 2-3h async
6. Analyze results & generate decision report (>10% = proceed, <5% = pivot) - 1h

**Research Foundation:**
- Meinke et al. (2024): 40-60% detection in lab conditions (cooperative AIs)
- Critical gap: Adversarial AIs probably 1/3 to 1/10 effectiveness (AIs optimized to defeat detection)
- Noise parameters: 10-20% input perturbation, variance threshold >15% suspicious, 3-5 benchmark cycles for pattern

**Decision Criteria:**
- >10% adversarial detection rate → SUCCESS (proceed to Phase 2C ensemble methods)
- 5-10% adversarial detection rate → MARGINAL (cost-benefit analysis needed)
- <5% adversarial detection rate → FAILURE (pivot to Phase 2D competitive equilibrium)

**Next Steps:** Reading existing infrastructure (Step 1)
**Blocking:** None
