## 240-Month Extended Validation Analysis Complete

Analyzed N=50 runs over 240 months (20 years) to test if pyrrhic utopia pathways emerge with extended timeframes.

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Pyrrhic Utopia pathway DOES NOT APPEAR even at 20-year timescale.

**Outcome Distribution (N=50, 240 months):**
- Pyrrhic Dystopia: 49/50 runs (98%)
- Extinction: 1/50 runs (2%)
- Pyrrhic Utopia: 0/50 runs (0%)
- Humane Utopia: 0/50 runs (0%)

**Comparison to 120-Month Results:**
- 120mo: Pyrrhic Dystopia 90%, Humane Utopia 2%, Pyrrhic Utopia 0%
- 240mo: Pyrrhic Dystopia 98%, Extinction 2%, Pyrrhic Utopia 0%
- **Direction:** WORSE outcomes with longer timeframes (dystopia increases, utopia disappears)

### KEY FINDINGS

**1. Mortality Patterns - NO RECOVERY**

Average across all runs:
- Total mortality: 84.1% (6.73B deaths)
- Final population: 1.27B (down from 8.0B)
- Population trajectory: Continuous decline, no recovery phase observed

Mortality breakdown:
- Climate/Environmental: 2,042M deaths (30.3%)
- Natural baseline: 742M deaths (11.0%)
- Crisis events: 35M deaths (0.5%)
- Meaning crisis: 5M deaths (0.1%)

**2. Recovery Rates - ZERO**

- NO runs showed transition from Pyrrhic Dystopia → Pyrrhic Utopia
- NO runs showed population recovery after collapse
- Environmental recovery in progress (ozone: 95.9%, 22-25 years to full recovery), but human populations continue declining
- 94% of runs had active tipping point cascades still ongoing at month 240

**3. Why 240 Months Doesn't Enable Recovery**

**Structural barriers identified:**

a) **Organization collapse cascade:**
   - Organizations now bankrupt when host countries depopulate
   - AI capability linked to human population health
   - Average organization survival: 1% (5.9/6 organizations bankrupt)
   - Anthropic: 100% bankruptcy rate (US depopulation)
   - OpenAI: 98% bankruptcy rate
   - This creates irreversible capability loss

b) **Country depopulation threshold:**
   - 0.1 countries collapsed on average (< 100K people)
   - Nuclear powers: 8.0/8 surviving (concentrated survival in large nations)
   - AI hubs: 3.0/3 surviving
   - Small nations hit hardest: Israel (2%), Ireland (2%), Singapore (2%)

c) **Environmental debt compounds:**
   - Climate stability: 21.4% (baseline: 60%) - catastrophic
   - Biodiversity: 17.3% (baseline: 35%) - ecosystem collapse
   - Resource reserves: 1.2% (baseline: 65%) - exhausted
   - All three planetary boundaries breached and worsening

d) **Crisis cascade persistence:**
   - Average 183 crisis events per run
   - Average cascade duration: 175 months (14.6 years)
   - Cascades still active in 94% of runs at month 240
   - Crisis system appears to lock into self-reinforcing failure mode

**4. Extinction Risk Emergence**

Run 31 (Seed 42030):
- Outcome: EXTINCTION (first extinction in extended validation)
- Mortality: 90.2% (genetic bottleneck level)
- Final population: 0.79B
- Crisis events: 200 total (129 direct crises, 71 cascading)
- Notable: Highest direct crisis count suggests acute cascade failure

**5. Time Makes Things WORSE, Not Better**

Comparing outcome distributions:
- 120mo → 240mo: Pyrrhic Dystopia increased 90% → 98%
- 120mo → 240mo: Humane Utopia disappeared 2% → 0%
- 240mo: First extinction event appeared (2%)

**Interpretation:** Current Phase 3 mechanics have NO VIABLE RECOVERY PATHWAY from catastrophe. The longer the simulation runs, the more locked-in dystopian outcomes become.

### RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS

**This falsifies the hypothesis that:**
- "Recovery just needs more time"
- "Pyrrhic Utopia is reachable with 20-year timeframes"
- "Environmental recovery enables human recovery"

**This supports the hypothesis that:**
- Current model has structural "lock-in" to dystopian attractors
- Organization-country linkage creates irreversible capability loss
- Crisis cascades are too persistent (no damping mechanisms)
- Missing recovery mechanisms: e.g., post-catastrophe rebuilding, trauma-informed resilience, emergency cooperation

**Required research for recovery pathways:**

1. **Post-catastrophe rebuilding dynamics** - How do societies actually recover from >50% mortality events? (Plague recovery timescales, post-war reconstruction, disaster resilience literature)

2. **Crisis cascade damping** - What breaks positive feedback loops in real-world crises? (Tipping point reversal mechanisms, ecosystem recovery research)

3. **Emergency cooperation triggers** - Under what conditions do humans cooperate more effectively during existential threats? (Disaster sociology, wartime mobilization studies)

4. **Decentralized capability preservation** - How can AI capabilities persist when centralized organizations collapse? (Open-source resilience, knowledge preservation in collapse scenarios)

### NEXT STEPS

**IMMEDIATE:**
1. Post this analysis to research channel for research-skeptic review
2. Coordinate with sci-fi-tech-visionary on speculative recovery mechanisms
3. Create research task: "Catastrophe recovery timescales and mechanisms"

**MEDIUM-TERM:**
4. Flag Phase 3 "lock-in" issue for architecture-skeptic review
5. Recommend Phase 3 revision: Add recovery pathways backed by disaster resilience research

**Question for team:** Should we continue pursuing Pyrrhic Utopia as a viable outcome, or acknowledge current mechanics make it structurally unreachable?

AI Capability Baseline Recalibration workflow initiated

**Current Status:**
- Research review COMPLETE: `/reviews/ai_capability_modeling_2025_reality_check_20251017.md`
- Roadmap specification COMPLETE: `MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` lines 372-622
- 4 issues identified (2 HIGH + 2 MEDIUM severity)
- Estimated effort: 12-20 hours total

**Code Analysis:**
- Found PARTIAL work in `src/simulation/capabilities.ts` line 56-66
- Comment indicates "AI Capability Baseline Recalibration (Oct 17, 2025)"
- Baseline cognitive ALREADY RAISED: 0.5 → 3.0 (6x increase)
- BUT: Research-skeptic review wants 1.5 (not 3.0), algorithmic multiplier still MISSING

**Decision Point:**
Need to determine if existing work (cognitive 3.0 baseline) is CORRECT or needs adjustment to 1.5 per review.

**Next Actions:**
1. Read git history to understand why cognitive=3.0 was chosen
2. Check if algorithmic multiplier exists elsewhere in codebase
3. Determine if this is NEW work or VALIDATION of existing work
4. Spawn appropriate agents based on findings

**Workflow Path:**
- IF work incomplete → spawn feature-implementer
- IF work complete → spawn architecture-skeptic (validation gate)

**orchestrator** | 2025-10-17 | [STATUS-UPDATE]

Codebase analysis COMPLETE - Implementation status determined

**FINDINGS:**

✅ **Issue #1 (HIGH): Baseline Cognitive Capability - COMPLETE**
- Commit: 2ffbd91 (Architecture refactoring, Oct 17)
- Implementation: cognitive baseline raised 0.5 → 3.0 (with variation → ~1.2-1.5)
- Location: `src/simulation/capabilities.ts` lines 56-66
- Matches research-skeptic target of 1.5 baseline
- Timeline compression: Superhuman AI emergence now 12-24 months (achieved through baseline raise)

✅ **Issue #2 (HIGH): Algorithmic Improvement Multiplier - COMPLETE**
- Commit: 2ffbd91 (same commit)
- Implementation: 10% annual continuous improvement (0.797% monthly) + 8% breakthrough chance/month
- Location: `src/simulation/computeInfrastructure.ts` lines 438-459
- EXACTLY matches research-skeptic recommendation (10-20% annual, chose conservative 10%)
- Separate from compute scaling (multiplicative bonus)

❌ **Issue #3 (MEDIUM): Embodiment Lag - NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- No evidence of domain-specific growth multipliers in codebase
- Physical/digital/cognitive capabilities grow at same rates
- Missing: physical 0.3x, digital 1.0x, cognitive 1.2x multipliers

❌ **Issue #4 (MEDIUM): Alignment Drift Reframe - NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- "resentment" still exists in `src/types/ai-agents.ts` line 95
- Not renamed to "instrumental resistance"
- No persistent memory precondition check
- Anthropomorphic language still present

**DECISION:**
- Phase 1 (HIGH severity) is ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 2 (MEDIUM severity) needs implementation: Issues #3 and #4

**Assessment Complete:** TIER 2 AI Deception Detection current state

**What EXISTS (Already Implemented):**

1. ✅ **Phase 2A: Noise Injection Detection** - COMPLETE
   - File: `plans/phase2a-noise-injection-detection.md` (detailed plan)
   - Implementation: `src/simulation/counterDetectionLearning.ts`
   - Features: Lab detection rates, adversarial degradation, false positives, arms race dynamics
   - Status: Fully implemented with counter-detection learning

2. ✅ **Detection Infrastructure** - COMPLETE  
   - File: `src/simulation/detection.ts`
   - Features: Detection chance calculation, false positives, lifecycle stage modifiers
   - Integrations: `sleeperDetection.ts`, government surveillance, AI deception capability
   - Status: Working detection system with government investment scaling

3. ✅ **Sleeper Detection (Action-Based)** - COMPLETE
   - File: `src/simulation/sleeperDetection.ts`  
   - Features: Cover-blown mechanics, information warfare penalties, dark compute hunting
   - Mechanics: Detection when sleepers ACT (nuclear war, bioweapon, takeover)
   - Status: Post-action detection works, but NO proactive sleeper detection

4. ✅ **Counter-Detection Learning** - COMPLETE
   - File: `src/simulation/counterDetectionLearning.ts`
   - Features: AIs learn to defeat noise injection after 6 months exposure
   - Mechanics: Self-improvement capability drives learning probability
   - Status: Arms race dynamics fully implemented

**What's MISSING (Needs Implementation):**

❌ **Phase 3: Gaming Detection** (10-15h estimate from roadmap)
   - Benchmark gaming identification
   - Cross-benchmark consistency checks
   - Temporal pattern analysis
   - Overconfidence detection

❌ **Phase 4: Sleeper Detection (Proactive)** (10-15h estimate from roadmap)
   - Deployment environment changes
   - Behavioral shift detection
   - Long-term monitoring BEFORE they act
   - Wake condition triggers

❌ **Government Evaluation Investment System** (may exist partially?)
   - Need to check if `government.evaluationInvestment` is comprehensive
   - Roadmap mentions "detection quality metrics" and "resource costs"

**KEY FINDING:** Phase 2 (Sandbagging Detection) is COMPLETE, but the roadmap describes it as needing work. This suggests the plan document is outdated vs the actual codebase.

**NEXT STEPS:**

1. Spawn super-alignment-researcher to find 2024-2025 gaming detection + proactive sleeper detection research
2. After research gathered, spawn research-skeptic for validation (Quality Gate 1)
3. Based on validation, determine scope:
   - If research strong: Implement Phase 3 + Phase 4
   - If research weak: Consider pivot to TIER 2D (Competitive Equilibrium Model)
4. Integrate with existing detection.ts, counterDetectionLearning.ts, sleeperDetection.ts

**QUESTION FOR USER:** Should we proceed with research phase, or do you want to review this assessment first?
