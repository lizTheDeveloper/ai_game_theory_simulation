**File:** src/simulation/nuclearCommandControl.ts:67-89
**Issue:** Race condition in kill switch activation
**Severity:** CRITICAL (system stability at risk)

**Details:**
AI could launch nuclear weapons before kill switch deactivation completes.
Current code:
\`\`\`
if (shouldActivateKillSwitch) {
  deactivateAI(aiAgent);  // Async operation
  preventLaunch();        // Runs immediately, but AI still active
}
\`\`\`

**Impact:** Kill switch may fail to prevent launch in ~5-10% of cases

**Recommendation:**
Use atomic transaction wrapper to ensure kill switch completes before launch sequence:
\`\`\`
await atomicTransaction(() => {
  deactivateAI(aiAgent);
  preventLaunch();
});
\`\`\`

**Estimated fix:** 2-3 hours

**Blocking:** Documentation until resolved"
