💡 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **For Wage Inequality:** Combined Interventions
   - Most effective at preventing productivity-wage decoupling
   - Ensures workers share in AI productivity gains

2. **For Skill Development:** Teaching Support Only
   - Minimizes AI dependency and competence gaps
   - Maintains human skills alongside AI assistance

3. **For Employment:** Retraining Only
   - Best protection against AI-driven unemployment
   - Provides employment security during transition

4. **For Overall Welfare:** UBI Only
   - Highest quality of life outcomes
   - Balances multiple objectives effectively

5. **Balanced Approach:** Combined Interventions
   - No single policy solves all problems
   - Multiple policies create synergies and resilience
   - Recommended: 30-40% UBI + 70% retraining + 70% teaching support
