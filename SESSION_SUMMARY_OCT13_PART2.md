# Session Summary: Monte Carlo Statistics Bug Fixes
**Date:** October 13, 2025, Part 2  
**Focus:** Fixing major statistical reporting bugs in Monte Carlo simulations

---

## 🐛 **Bugs Identified & Fixed**

### **1. Argument Parsing Bug** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** User requested 20-year (240 months) simulation, but it ran for 50 years (600 months)  
**Root Cause:** Script expected `--runs=X --max-months=Y` flags but `runMonteCarlo.sh` passed positional args  
**Fix:** Added support for both positional and flag-based arguments  
**Result:** Simulations now correctly run for specified duration

### **2. Nuclear War Count** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem:** Summary showed "0 nuclear wars" but logs had 37,000+ events  
**Root Cause:** Code was filtering `runResult.log.events.criticalEvents` which wasn't populated  
**Fix:** Use `EventAggregator.stats.nuclearWarsTriggered` + `nuclearDeterrenceFailed` instead  
**Result:** Should now accurately count nuclear wars from aggregated stats

### **3. Outcome Emoji Mapping** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem:** All runs showed ❓ emoji instead of proper outcome indicators  
**Root Cause:** Code only supported old 4-outcome system (utopia/dystopia/extinction/stalemate)  
**Fix:** Added emoji mapping for 7-tier system:
- 🌟 Utopia
- 🏛️ Dystopia  
- 💀 Extinction
- ⚰️ Terminal
- 🧬 Bottleneck
- 🏚️ Dark Age
- 💥 Collapse
- ⚠️ Crisis Era
- 📊 Status Quo

**Result:** Outcomes should now show meaningful emoji and detailed classification

### **4. Raw Outcome Storage** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem:** Summary only showed mapped categories, losing detailed outcome info  
**Fix:** Store `rawOutcome` in results object alongside `outcome`  
**Result:** Can now report both simplified category and detailed 7-tier outcome

### **5. Organization Bankruptcies Tracking** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem:** No tracking of organization failures during simulations  
**Fix:** Added `organizationBankruptcies` field, populated from `EventAggregator.stats.organizationsBankrupt`  
**Result:** Can now track how many organizations failed during each run

## 🔴 **Bugs Still Remaining**

### **1. AI Hubs Surviving: -1.0 / 3** 🐛  
**Problem:** Negative number in statistics (impossible)  
**Impact:** Corrupts country depopulation analysis  
**Source:** `countrySys.aiHubsSurviving` returning -1  
**Priority:** Medium

### **2. Famine System Not Triggering** 🐛  
**Problem:** 0 famines reported despite food security < 0.4 in multiple runs  
**Impact:** Famines aren't triggering even when conditions are met  
**Evidence:** Food security drops below 0.4 threshold but no "🌾💀 GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS FAMINE" messages  
**Priority:** High (affects realism)

### **3. Organizations Never Bankrupt** 🐛  
**Problem:** 100% organization survival despite 95%+ population collapse  
**Impact:** Unrealistic economic behavior during bottleneck scenarios  
**Evidence:** 
- 10/10 runs: 95.5-95.6% mortality
- 10/10 runs: 0 bankruptcies
- Organizations accumulate $7.6T despite collapse  
**Priority:** High (affects realism)

### **4. Basic Needs QoL Anomaly** 🐛  
**Problem:** Basic Needs QoL = 1.85 despite 96% mortality  
**Impact:** Quality of life calculations don't reflect human suffering  
**Evidence:** 
- 96% population decline
- Food security < 0.4
- But Basic Needs shows "post-scarcity" levels (1.85/1.0)  
**Priority:** Medium

### **5. Per-Run Population Breakdown Missing** 🐛  
**Problem:** Summary doesn't show per-run final populations  
**Impact:** Hard to see variance between runs  
**Requested By:** User  
**Priority:** Low (UI enhancement)

## 📊 **Current Simulation Behavior (20-year runs)**

From the 240-month simulation (before fixes):

### Consistent Patterns:
- **100% Bottleneck rate** (all 10 runs)
- **95.5-95.6% mortality** (350-360M survivors)
- **37,352 nuclear deterrence failures** across 10 runs (~3,735 per run)
- **100% environmental cascade rate**
- **0% famine triggers** (despite conditions met)
- **0% organization bankruptcies** (despite collapse)

### System State at End:
- Climate Stability: 89.3%
- Biodiversity: 94.7%
- Resource Reserves: 5.7% (crisis threshold breached)
- Food Security: 0.439 (below crisis threshold)
- Gini Coefficient: 95.7% (extreme inequality)

### Crises:
- 2,000-75,000 crisis events per run (high variance)
- 100% of countries depopulated
- 100% tipping point cascades active
- 45% of population in crisis-affected regions

## 🧪 **Testing Status**

1. ✅ **First run (20-year):** Completed, identified bugs
2. ✅ **Fixes implemented:** Code changes committed
3. 🔄 **Re-run in progress:** `twenty_year_with_fixes` (using fixed code)
4. ⏳ **Waiting for results:** Should show corrected statistics

**Expected improvements in new run:**
- Nuclear wars: ~37K (not 0)
- Outcome emoji: 🧬 (not ❓)
- AI Hubs: positive number (not -1)
