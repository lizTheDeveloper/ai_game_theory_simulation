/**
 * Social Safety Nets & Community Infrastructure System (TIER 2.2)
 * 
 * Physical and social infrastructure to combat loneliness epidemic and enable community flourishing.
 * Based on WHO (2025), Harvard Making Caring Common (2024), US Surgeon General (2024),
 * University of Texas (2025), World Bank (2025).
 * 
 * Key Finding: "Three-quarters of those surveyed said they wanted more opportunities 
 * to develop meaningful relationships. Public and private leaders must build up social 
 * infrastructure to help people develop meaningful connections." - Harvard (Oct 2024)
