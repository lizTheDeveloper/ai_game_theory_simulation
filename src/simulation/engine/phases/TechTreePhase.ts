/**
 * TechTreePhase (12.5)
 *
 * Updates technology tree: checks for new tech unlocks, applies deployment actions,
 * updates research progress, and calculates tech effects.
 *
 * **EXECUTION ORDER:** 12.5 (after upward spirals, before social/environmental)
 * **DEPENDENCIES:**
 * - Reads AI capabilities (for unlock conditions)
 * - Reads economic stage (for unlock conditions)
 * - Reads government research investments
 * - Reads organization revenues
 * - Writes tech unlock status, deployment levels, effects
 *
 * **SIDE EFFECTS:**
 * - Unlocks new technologies when prerequisites are met
 * - Applies deployment actions from AIs and nations
 * - Updates research progress toward locked tech
 * - Applies tech effects to game state (scales with deployment level)
