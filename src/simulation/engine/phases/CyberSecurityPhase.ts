/**
 * CyberSecurityPhase (0.2)
 *
 * Cybersecurity arms race - attempts to breach closed AI systems.
 * Attack power (from misaligned AIs) vs Defense power (from government)
 * determines:
 * - Leak probability for closed systems
 * - Spread multiplier for open systems
 *
 * **EXECUTION ORDER:** 0.2 (After lifecycle, before sleeper wake)
 * **DEPENDENCIES:** Requires AI agents to exist
 * **SIDE EFFECTS:**
 * - Converts closed systems to open weights if breached
 * - Updates spreadCount for breached systems
