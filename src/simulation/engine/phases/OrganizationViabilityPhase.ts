/**
 * TIER 1.7.3: Organization Viability Phase
 * 
 * Checks if organizations can survive based on their host country's population health.
 * Links organization survival to country population - more realistic than 100% survival!
 * 
 * Organizations collapse when:
 * 1. Host country is depopulated (<100K people)
 * 2. Host country population drops below organization's survival threshold
 * 
 * Research: Google is ~1% of US economy, can't function if US loses 70% of population
