/**
 * Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Phase
 *
 * Updates antibiotic resistance and applies medical effectiveness decline
 * Order: 15.0 (after environmental hazards, before QoL calculation)
 *
 * Research foundation:
 * - WHO (2024): 10M annual deaths by 2050 (TRL 9)
 * - O'Neill Review (2016): $100T economic damage
 * - Lancet (2022): 1.27M deaths in 2019
 *
 * Mechanism:
 * 1. Apply mitigation from breakthrough technologies
 * 2. Update antibiotic resistance prevalence
 * 3. Calculate current mortality rate (exponential growth)
 * 4. Calculate medical effectiveness decline
 * 5. Apply mortality to population
 * 6. Update medical effectiveness impacts (surgery risk, healthcare quality)
 * 7. Calculate economic impact
