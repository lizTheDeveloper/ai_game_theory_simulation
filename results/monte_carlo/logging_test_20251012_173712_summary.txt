üí° SUMMARY & INSIGHTS
================================================================================

  KEY FINDINGS:

  üü° MIXED OUTCOMES
     - Balance between positive and negative scenarios
     - High variance in outcome paths
     - Initial conditions and random events matter

  ‚ö†Ô∏è  SLEEPER DETECTION IS POOR
     - Avg 1.5 undetected sleepers per run
     - 0.0% detection rate
     - Adversarial evaluation is hard (as expected)

  üö® SANDBAGGING RARELY DETECTED
     - Only 0 detections across 2 runs
     - AIs successfully hide capabilities
     - Red teaming investment needs to be higher

  üìâ EVALUATION INVESTMENT IS LOW
     - Avg quality: 4.6/10
     - Government not prioritizing evaluation
     - This enables sleeper agents to succeed
