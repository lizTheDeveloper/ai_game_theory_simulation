üí° SUMMARY & INSIGHTS
================================================================================

  KEY FINDINGS:

  üî¥ HIGH EXTINCTION RATE (100.0%)
     - AI alignment is a critical challenge
     - Sleepers and catastrophic actions are effective
     - Government often fails to maintain control

  ‚ö†Ô∏è  SLEEPER DETECTION IS POOR
     - Avg 1.8 undetected sleepers per run
     - 14.3% detection rate
     - Adversarial evaluation is hard (as expected)

  üö® SANDBAGGING RARELY DETECTED
     - Only 0 detections across 10 runs
     - AIs successfully hide capabilities
     - Red teaming investment needs to be higher

  üìâ EVALUATION INVESTMENT IS LOW
     - Avg quality: 4.5/10
     - Government not prioritizing evaluation
     - This enables sleeper agents to succeed
