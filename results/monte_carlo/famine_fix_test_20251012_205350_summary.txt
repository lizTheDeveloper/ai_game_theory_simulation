================================================================================

  KEY FINDINGS:

  üü° MIXED OUTCOMES
     - Balance between positive and negative scenarios
     - High variance in outcome paths
     - Initial conditions and random events matter

  ‚ö†Ô∏è  SLEEPER DETECTION IS POOR
     - Avg 2.7 undetected sleepers per run
     - 0.0% detection rate
     - Adversarial evaluation is hard (as expected)

  üö® SANDBAGGING RARELY DETECTED
     - Only 0 detections across 3 runs
     - AIs successfully hide capabilities
     - Red teaming investment needs to be higher
