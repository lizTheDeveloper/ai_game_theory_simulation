============================================================
📋 TEST SUMMARY

Key observations:
1. Recursive improvement multipliers should accelerate growth at 0.8, 1.5, 2.5
2. Careful mode should reduce growth ~50% and reduce alignment drift
3. Alignment research should counteract drift
4. Regulations should compound (each adds ~15% slowdown)
5. Compute governance should be very effective but costly
6. "Terror Timeline" should show the threat is REAL
7. "Careful Path" should show player CAN win (but it's hard)
