# Bug Fix Status (October 13, 2025 - Evening)

## 🚨 **Critical Bug Discovered & Fixed**

### **Bug #8: Organization Expense Const Assignment**

**Discovered:** October 13, 2025 @ 23:45 (during Monte Carlo run)

**Error:**
```
❌ ERROR in phase "Organization Turns" (organization-turns): TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    at calculateTotalExpenses (/src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts:707:5)
```

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// Line 678 - WRONG
const dcOperational = state.computeInfrastructure.dataCenters
  .filter(dc => org.ownedDataCenters.includes(dc.id) && dc.operational)
  .reduce((sum, dc) => sum + dc.operationalCost, 0);

// Later, lines 707, 711 - CRASH
if (crisisCount >= 4) {
  dcOperational *= 1.5; // ❌ Can't reassign const!
}
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Changed to let
let dcOperational = state.computeInfrastructure.dataCenters
  .filter(dc => org.ownedDataCenters.includes(dc.id) && dc.operational)
  .reduce((sum, dc) => sum + dc.operationalCost, 0);

// Now works
if (crisisCount >= 4) {
  dcOperational *= 1.5; // ✅ Can modify let variable
}
```

**Impact:**
- **When it crashes:** During crisis conditions (4+ active crises)
- **Why:** Crisis multipliers try to modify DC operational costs
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - All Monte Carlo runs crash mid-simulation
- **Fixed in:** Commit `f258cbe`

## 🧪 **Current Testing Status**

### **Test Run:** `famine_verified_fixed_oct13`
- **Started:** 21:14:26
- **Configuration:** 10 runs × 240 months (20 years)
- **Status:** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (18MB log, still running)
- **Expected:** Completes without crashing, famines trigger correctly

### **Previous Test Run:** `complete_famine_verification_oct13`

## 🔍 **How We Found It**

1. Ran comprehensive Monte Carlo: `complete_famine_verification_oct13`
2. Simulation ran for ~15 minutes, produced 17MB log
3. Crashed at line 510493 with `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable`
4. Stack trace pointed to `calculateTotalExpenses:707`
5. Found `const dcOperational` being modified with `*=`
6. Changed to `let`, re-ran test
7. Now running cleanly (18MB and counting)

## ✅ **Verification Plan**

### **Success Criteria**
- [🔄] Runs complete without crashing
- [⬜] Famines trigger when food < 0.4
- [⬜] Death breakdown sums to ~100%
- [⬜] Organizations fail during collapse
- [⬜] Reporting stats accurate

### **Expected Results**
```
Population: 8.00B → 0.2-0.5B (94-97% decline)
Outcomes: BOTTLENECK or TERMINAL
Famines: > 0 (food security drops below 0.4)
Famine Deaths: 100-500M (depending on when triggered)
Organizations: Bankruptcies during crisis
```

## 🎓 **Key Learning**

**Always declare variables with `let` if they'll be modified later!**

This bug was hidden during normal operations but triggered during crisis conditions when expense multipliers kicked in. The lesson: test edge cases (high crisis scenarios) to catch these bugs.
