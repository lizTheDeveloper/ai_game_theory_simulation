Use these emojis consistently across all wiki pages to indicate the current implementation status of systems and features.

### Status Indicators

| Emoji | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| ✅ | **Fully Working** | Implemented, tested, and functioning as designed |
| ⚠️ | **Needs Tuning** | Implemented but requires balancing or parameter adjustments |
| 🚧 | **In Development** | Currently being implemented (WIP) |
| 📋 | **Planned** | Designed/specified but not yet started |
| ❌ | **Deprecated** | Removed or replaced by newer system |
| 🔧 | **Bug/Needs Fix** | Broken or has known issues requiring fixes |

## Consistency Notes

### System Names
- **Organizations System** (not "Org System")
- **Compute Infrastructure** (not "Data Centers")
- **AI Agents** (not "AIs" when referring to system)
- **Quality of Life System** (QoL OK in text)
- **Extinction System** (not "End Game")

### Terminology
- **Capability** = AI problem-solving ability
