- **Crisis Recovery**: Technologies can reverse active environmental and social crises
- **Governance Quality**: Democratic resilience, AI-augmented decision quality, authoritarian resistance (Phase 2C)
- **Upward Spirals**: 6 virtuous cascades (Abundance, Cognitive, Democratic, Scientific, Meaning, Ecological) with cross-amplification (Phase 2D)
- **Meaning Renaissance**: 4 dimensions of cultural flourishing (purpose diversity, self-actualization, artistic renaissance, philosophical maturity) (Phase 2E)
- **Conflict Resolution**: AI-mediated diplomacy, post-scarcity peace dividend, cyber defense systems (Phase 2F)
- **Nuclear Deterrence**: 5 nuclear states, MAD mechanics, escalation ladder, reduced nuclear war 80% → 20% (Oct 2025)

### What Needs Tuning ⚠️

**See [Diagnostic Findings](./DIAGNOSTIC_FINDINGS.md) for detailed analysis**

**Top 5 Blockers Identified:**
1. **Deployment Bottleneck** - 9 techs unlocked, 0 deployed (Month 84) 🚨
2. **Cognitive Spiral Catch-22** - Trust collapses before AI capability threshold
3. **Resource/Ecosystem Death Spiral** - 100% of cascades, never recovers
4. **Surveillance-Autonomy Trap** - Autonomy → 0%, blocks Meaning spiral
5. **Community Cohesion** - Stuck at 63%, need 70%

**Fixes Implemented (Phase 2F+):**
- ✅ AI-accelerated deployment (1.2x-1.9x based on capability)
- ✅ Autonomy floor & recovery mechanics (prevents 0% lock-in)
- ✅ Community cohesion enhancement (post-scarcity + tech bonuses)
- ✅ Distribution efficiency modeling

**Expected:** 10-30% Utopia rate (testing in progress)

### What's Planned 📋

- **Government Research Prioritization**: Strategic tech research allocation actions
- **Technology Synergies**: Combinations of technologies with enhanced effects
- **International dynamics**: Multiple governments, tech sharing/racing
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Explicit AI coalitions
- **Public opinion**: More granular trust mechanics influenced by tech breakthroughs

## 📊 Current Simulation Characteristics

Based on recent Monte Carlo results (October 2025):

| Metric | Latest Results | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Outcome: Dystopia** | 60% | Surveillance state lock-in dominant pathway |
| **Outcome: Extinction** | 40% | All via nuclear war (diplomatic AI not intervening yet) |
| **Outcome: Utopia** | 0% | Upward spirals not activating despite Phase 2D-F implementation |
| **Game Duration** | 120 months avg | Testing with 60-120 month runs |
| **Max AI Capability** | 2.5-3.0 | Good range for danger modeling |
| **Economic Stage Reached** | 3-4 | Post-scarcity transitions occurring |
| **Crisis Cascades** | Common | 6 simultaneous crises observed (3.0x degradation) |
| **Golden Age Duration** | 5-30 months | Fragile, often collapses into crisis cascade |
| **QoL Degradation** | Severe | Social: 0.45, Psychological: 0.59 (lowest categories) |
| **Breakthrough Unlocks** | 266 avg/run | Technologies unlocking but deployment too slow |
| **Diplomatic AI Deployment** | 100% of runs | Deployed Month 30-40 but not intervening |
| **Virtuous Cascades** | 0 observed | Upward spirals not reaching activation threshold |

> **Note**: Recent implementation of Phase 2B-F (Dystopia Lock-In, Governance Quality, Upward Spirals, Meaning Renaissance, Conflict Resolution) adds virtuous cascades and multiple Utopia paths. However, testing shows 0% Utopia due to spiral activation blockers (slow deployment, meaning crisis persistent). Target: 10-20% Utopia with tuning.
