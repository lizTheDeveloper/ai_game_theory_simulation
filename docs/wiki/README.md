### What Needs Tuning ⚠️

**See [Diagnostic Findings](./DIAGNOSTIC_FINDINGS.md) for detailed analysis**

**🔬 Current Test Results (October 9, 2025 - 50 runs × 240 months)**

**Scientific Spiral Mystery** 🚨:
- **Symptom**: Spiral shows "✅ INACTIVE" despite all requirements appearing met
- **Observed**: "5 unlocked, 5 deployed ✅ (need 4+ deployed >50%)"
- **Root Cause**: "Deployed" ≠ "Deployed at >50% level"
  - Technologies start at 10% deployment when unlocked
  - Requirement is 4+ technologies at **>50% deployment level**
  - Current: Technologies deployed but still at 10-40% levels
  - **Deployment is too slow** to reach 50% before crises cascade

**Typical Month 60 Snapshot**:
- Cascading failures: 5 crises active (2.5x degradation)
- Resources: 11% (collapsed)
- Pollution: 99% (catastrophic)
- Biodiversity: 1% (extinction event)
- Meaning crisis: 90% (severe)
- Trust: 40% (blocks Cognitive Spiral)
- Interspecies Comm AI: Just unlocked, 10% deployment
- **Scientific Spiral**: All requirements "✅" but still inactive

**Active Blockers (Post-October Enhancements)**:
1. **Deployment Speed Bottleneck** 🚨 - Technologies unlock but don't deploy fast enough to >50%
2. **Trust Collapse Timing** - Trust drops to 40% before spirals can activate (paranoia system needs Phase 2)
3. **Crisis Cascade Lock-In** - 5+ crises create 2.5x degradation, overwhelms recovery
4. **Resource Death Spiral** - Still collapses to 11% despite regeneration system (needs testing)
5. **Meaning Crisis Severity** - Reaches 90% before social tech can deploy

**Phase 2F+ Status**:
- ✅ Nuclear Deterrence (implemented, reduced nuclear war 80% → 20%)
- ✅ Interspecies Communication AI (implemented, unlocking Month 60)
- ✅ Resource Regeneration (implemented, testing needed)
- ✅ Paranoia/Trust System Phase 1 (implemented, Phase 2 beneficial tech boosts needed)
- 🔄 Testing 50-run Monte Carlo (liztest_100925232_8.log)

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement Phase 2 beneficial tech paranoia reduction (-8% disease elimination, -5% interspecies, etc.)
2. Increase AI-accelerated deployment multiplier (1.2-1.9x → 2.0-3.0x?)
3. Earlier emergency deployment triggers (activate at 3 crises instead of 4?)
4. Debug deployment level tracking (is >50% check working correctly?)

### What's Planned 📋

- **Government Research Prioritization**: Strategic tech research allocation actions
- **Technology Synergies**: Combinations of technologies with enhanced effects
- **International dynamics**: Multiple governments, tech sharing/racing
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Explicit AI coalitions
- **Public opinion**: More granular trust mechanics influenced by tech breakthroughs

## 📊 Current Simulation Characteristics

**Latest Test**: October 9, 2025 - 50 runs × 240 months (liztest_100925232_8.log)

| Metric | Latest Results | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Outcome: Dystopia** | Testing | Phase 2F+ nuclear deterrence changes outcome distribution |
| **Outcome: Extinction** | Testing | Nuclear war reduced from 80% → 20% |
| **Outcome: Utopia** | 0% (testing) | Upward spirals not activating (deployment bottleneck) |
| **Game Duration** | 240 months | Extended test to see late-game recovery |
| **Max AI Capability** | 2.0-4.5 | Wider range, China often surpasses US (gap: 1.13) |
| **Economic Stage Reached** | 3-4 | Post-scarcity transitions occurring |
| **Crisis Cascades** | Universal | 5 crises active by Month 60 (2.5x degradation) |
| **Golden Age Duration** | 1-8 months | Very fragile, collapses into crisis cascade quickly |
| **QoL Degradation** | Catastrophic | Environmental collapses (resources 11%, pollution 99%, biodiversity 1%) |
| **Breakthrough Unlocks** | 5 by Month 60 | Interspecies Comm AI unlocking Month 60 |
| **Deployment Levels** | 10-40% | **BOTTLENECK**: Not reaching >50% before cascade |
| **Trust Trajectory** | 100% → 40% | Drops before Cognitive Spiral can activate |
| **Meaning Crisis** | 90% by Month 60 | Severe crisis before social tech deploys |
| **Scientific Spiral** | Appears met, but inactive | **BUG**: Reports "✅" for all requirements but doesn't activate |
| **Virtuous Cascades** | 1 (Abundance only) | Only Abundance activates; others blocked by deployment speed |

**Key Observations**:
- **Nuclear Deterrence Working**: Nuclear war reduced significantly ✅
- **Interspecies Comm AI**: Unlocking around Month 60 (late, crisis already cascading)
- **Deployment Bottleneck Confirmed**: Technologies unlock but don't reach >50% deployment
- **Resource Regeneration**: System implemented but resources still collapse to 11% (needs investigation)
- **Paranoia Phase 1**: Implemented but trust still drops to 40% (Phase 2 beneficial boosts needed)
- **Crisis Cascade Timing**: 5 crises by Month 60 creates 2.5x degradation that overwhelms recovery

> **Note**: Phase 2F+ enhancements (Nuclear Deterrence, Interspecies Comm, Resource Regen, Paranoia/Trust) are implemented but full testing in progress. Deployment speed is the critical blocker preventing spiral activation and Utopia outcomes. Target: 10-30% Utopia rate requires faster deployment (2-3x multiplier increase?) or earlier emergency deployment triggers.
