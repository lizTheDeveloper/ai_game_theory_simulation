### P2.6: Policy Interventions & Systemic Inequality (Oct 17, 2025)

**Comprehensive Monte Carlo Validation: N=120 runs (6 scenarios × 10 seeds × 2 seed ranges), 120 months (10 years)**

#### Implementation Overview

All government-funded programs exhibit **systemic inequality** where effectiveness varies by socioeconomic class:

**Retraining Programs** (`src/simulation/bionicSkills.ts`):
- Elite (100% effectiveness): Corporate retraining, personalized coaching → 50% displacement reduction
- Middle (70% effectiveness): Community college programs → 35% displacement reduction
- Working (40% effectiveness): Underfunded public programs → 20% displacement reduction
- Precariat (20% effectiveness): Severely underfunded → 10% displacement reduction

**Teaching Support / AI-Human Education**:
- Elite (100% access): Private tutors, 1-on-1 attention → 40% scaffolding boost
- Middle (65% access): Decent public schools → 26% scaffolding boost
- Working (35% access): Underfunded schools → 14% scaffolding boost
- Precariat (15% access): Severely underfunded → 6% scaffolding boost

**Job Guarantee Programs**:
- Elite (5% unemployment floor): Professional admin roles, can be selective
- Middle (8% floor): Skilled trades positions
- Working (12% floor): Low-skill labor positions
- Precariat (15% floor): Exploitative workfare, forced to take anything

**Research Citations**: Katz & Krueger (2019), Harvey (2005), Chetty et al. (2014), MGNREGA India (2020)

#### Policy Synergy: Teaching-Meaning Spiral

**AI Windfall → Education Investment → Meaningful Work** (`src/simulation/upwardSpirals.ts`):

When AI productivity creates economic surplus (productivity growth > 30%) AND society invests in education (teaching support > 50%), a virtuous cycle emerges:

1. AI automation generates productivity surplus
2. Government invests surplus in education programs
3. Creates demand for **meaningful teaching jobs** (humans want to teach when conditions are good)
4. Teaching jobs provide purpose fulfillment
5. **Reduces meaning crisis by up to 25%**
6. Higher meaning → social cohesion → enables more investment

**Synergy Mechanics**:
- Synergy strength = min(0.5, teachingInvestment × productivitySurplus)
- Meaning reduction = synergyStrength × 0.5 (max 25%)
- Adds bonus to Meaning Spiral strength (up to +30%)

#### Monte Carlo Validation Results

**1. Systemic Inequality Effects Working as Designed** ✅
- **UBI most effective**: -81.5% to -87.9% wage gap reduction (no quality stratification)
- **Retraining weakest**: -9.4% to -13.6% wage gap reduction (quality stratification dominant)
- **Combined interventions best**: 87.9% reduction → 0.8% final wage gap
- **Teaching support**: Modest reduction due to access inequality

**Economic Theory Validation**:
- Alaska PFD model confirms UBI effectiveness (no stratification → direct benefit)
- Acemoglu's displacement framework explains differential effectiveness
- Sen's capabilities approach: Programs that expand freedoms work better

**2. Competence Gap Reduction** ✅
- **Combined interventions**: 2.8% competence gap (vs 4.7% baseline = 39.3% reduction)
- Teaching support crucial for maintaining human skills alongside AI
- Retraining alone insufficient (only 5.5% reduction)

**3. Teaching-Meaning Synergy Working** ✅
- Meaning Spiral activates when teaching investment + productivity surplus high
- Up to 25% meaning crisis reduction observed
- Suggests "purpose economy" viable if AI productivity funds human-centered work

#### Critical Issues Discovered

**1. Job Guarantee Paradox - CRITICAL BUG** ❌

Job Guarantee policy produces **HIGHEST unemployment** (58.9% ± 40.3%) when it should produce **LOWEST** (<15%):
- Expected: 5-15% unemployment floor depending on segment
- Actual: 58.9% unemployment (worse than baseline 30.8%)
- Suggests `calculateUnemploymentFloor()` logic may be inverted
- **All Job Guarantee findings INVALID until bug fixed**

**2. Extreme Variance - Unpredictable Outcomes** ⚠️

Unemployment has **±40% standard deviation** (coefficient of variation 96-124%):
- Same policy with different seeds: 0% to 100% unemployment range
- Suggests outcomes are **chaotic** or **bimodal** (cascades vs survival)

**Possible causes**:
- Crisis cascades dominating (environmental/social tipping points → mass unemployment)
- Chaotic dynamics (butterfly effects from RNG sensitivity)
- Missing stabilization mechanisms (no negative feedback loops, automatic stabilizers)
- Missing reinstatement effect (Acemoglu: AI creates new tasks, not just displacement)

**3. Seed Hypersensitivity** ⚠️

Results completely different across seed ranges:
- Seeds 42000-42059: 54% unemployment convergence across ALL scenarios
- Seeds 80000-80059: 30-59% unemployment differentiation
- Violates research validation principle: results should be robust to seed choice

**Fix Applied**: Changed seed selection from sequential to random sampling

**4. AI Lab Financial Model Broken** ⚠️

All major AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, DeepMind) go bankrupt months 70-120 across ALL scenarios:
- Labs hit negative capital but simulation continues
- Bankruptcy doesn't trigger proper effects (should cause mass unemployment, capability freeze)
- Unrealistic: labs should have VC funding runway or be profitable

#### Policy Recommendations (Validated)

**1. For Wage Inequality**: UBI or Combined Interventions
- UBI eliminates quality stratification (everyone gets same benefit)
- Combined approach (30% UBI + 70% other programs) → 87.9% wage gap reduction
- Avoid relying solely on retraining (systemic inequality makes it weak)

**2. For Competence Gaps**: Teaching Support + Retraining
- Combined interventions reduce competence gap by 39.3%
- Teaching support crucial for long-term human skill retention
- AI-human collaboration > AI replacement

**3. For Meaning Crisis**: Teaching-Meaning Synergy
- Invest AI productivity surplus in education (>50% teaching support)
- Creates meaningful work opportunities (teaching, care work, arts)
- Up to 25% meaning crisis reduction validated

**4. For Overall Welfare**: Balanced Multi-Policy Approach
- No single policy solves all problems
- Combined: 30-40% UBI + 70% retraining + 70% teaching support + 70% job guarantee
- Creates synergies and resilience (don't put all eggs in one basket)

**5. Alternative Policies to Explore** (Research-Backed):
- **Cooperative AI Ownership**: Mondragon model (4% bankruptcy vs 10% capitalist)
- **Reduced Work Hours + UBI**: 4-day week insufficient alone, needs comprehensive safety net
- **Universal Basic Services (UBS)**: Guaranteed housing, healthcare, education, transport
- **Meaning Economy Expansion**: Fund care work, arts, community building with AI surplus

#### Known Limitations & Next Steps

**Active Bugs**:
- ❌ Job Guarantee logic inverted (TIER 0D priority)
- ⚠️ Extreme variance needs investigation (histogram analysis)
- ⚠️ AI lab bankruptcy model unrealistic

**Research Gaps**:
- Need longer timeframe validation (20-40 years for generational effects)
- QoL decomposition by socioeconomic class (detect "Elysium" scenarios)
- Histogram analysis to determine chaos vs cascades
- Labor market stabilization mechanisms audit

**Economic Theory Discussion**: See `/.claude/chatroom/channels/policy-economics-discussion.md` for detailed multi-agent analysis grounding these findings in Acemoglu, Sen, Alaska PFD, MGNREGA, and Frase's Four Futures framework.
