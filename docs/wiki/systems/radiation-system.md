## Overview

### Why This System Is Critical

Nuclear war doesn't end when the bombs stop falling. The radiation system models the decades-long health catastrophe that follows nuclear strikes:
- **Acute radiation syndrome:** 50-80% mortality within weeks
- **Cancer epidemic:** 40 years of elevated cancer rates
- **Genetic damage:** Birth defects across 3 generations (~75 years)
- **Environmental contamination:** 30-300 years before land is habitable again

**Distinction from Nuclear Winter:**

| System | Timeframe | Effect | Affected Area |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Nuclear Radiation** | Decades to centuries | Health effects (cancer, birth defects) | Localized to exposed regions |
| **Nuclear Winter** | 5-10 years | Climate effects (temperature drop, crop failure) | Global atmospheric effects |

**Historical Validation:**
- **Hiroshima/Nagasaki (1945):** 70+ years of longitudinal health data
- **Chernobyl (1986):** 39 years of exclusion zone studies
- **Fukushima (2011):** 14 years of contamination tracking

**Critical Feature:** Unlike instant-death models, this system captures the slow suffering—cancer patients dying in their 40s-50s, children born with defects for three generations, farmland poisoned for centuries.

## State Tracking

### RadiationExposureEvent Interface

Each nuclear strike creates a radiation exposure event that tracks decades of health effects:

```typescript
export interface RadiationExposureEvent {
  id: string;
  startMonth: number;           // When exposure occurred
  region: string;                // 'Asia', 'Europe', 'North America', etc.
  exposedPopulation: number;     // Population in billions
  exposureLevel: number;         // [0, 1] where 1 = lethal dose (6+ Gy)

  // === ACUTE EFFECTS (Weeks 1-4) ===
  acuteRadiationDeaths: number;  // Immediate deaths from ARS
  acuteRadiationSyndrome: {
    affectedPopulation: number;  // Exposed survivors
    mortalityRate: number;       // 50-80% at 4-6 Gy
    monthsActive: number;        // Duration of acute phase (1-2 months)
  };

  // === LONG-TERM CANCER (Years 5-40) ===
  cancerRisk: {
    baselineRate: number;        // Normal cancer rate (0.40 = 40%)
    radiationBonus: number;      // +10-30% additional risk
    latencyYears: number;        // 5-year minimum before cancers appear
    peakYears: number;           // 20-30 years = peak incidence
    durationYears: number;       // 40+ years total
    cumulativeCancerDeaths: number;  // Track total cancer deaths
  };

  // === BIRTH DEFECTS (3 Generations = ~75 years) ===
  birthDefects: {
    baselineRate: number;        // Normal rate (0.03 = 3%)
    radiationMultiplier: number; // 2-5x for exposed populations
    affectedGenerations: number; // 3 generations
    generationDuration: number;  // ~25 years per generation
    cumulativeDefects: number;   // Track total affected births
  };

  // === ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION ===
  contamination: {
    cesium137HalfLife: number;   // 30 years (in months: 360)
    strontium90HalfLife: number; // 29 years (in months: 348)
    iodine131HalfLife: number;   // 8 days (in months: 0.27)
    currentContaminationLevel: number;  // [0, 1] Current contamination
    agricultureImpossible: boolean;     // Is farming viable?
    waterContamination: number;         // [0, 1] Drinking water safety
    timeToRecoveryYears: number;        // Optimistic: 100 years
  };
}
```

### RadiationSystem Interface

System-wide tracking of all radiation exposures:

```typescript
export interface RadiationSystem {
  activeExposures: RadiationExposureEvent[];   // Currently ongoing effects
  historicalExposures: RadiationExposureEvent[]; // Ended exposures
  totalRadiationDeaths: number;                // All radiation deaths (acute + cancer)
  totalCancerDeaths: number;                   // Cancer deaths only
  totalBirthDefects: number;                   // Birth defects across all generations
  contaminatedRegions: Set<string>;            // Regions with active contamination
}
```

---

## Mechanics

### 1. Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)

**Timeframe:** Weeks 1-4 after exposure

**Medical Basis:** Acute radiation sickness at 4-6 Gy (Grays) has 50-80% mortality rate.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Calculate acute effects
const arsAffected = exposedPopulation * exposureLevel;  // Who got exposed
const arsMortalityRate = 0.5 + (exposureLevel * 0.3);   // 50-80% at full dose
const acuteDeaths = arsAffected * arsMortalityRate;

// Example: 100M exposed at full dose (1.0)
// → 100M affected × 0.8 = 80M deaths in first month
```

**Dose-Response Relationship:**

| Exposure Level | Dose (Gy) | Mortality Rate | Example: 100M Exposed |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| 0.3 (low) | 1-2 Gy | 59% | 59M deaths |
| 0.5 (medium) | 3-4 Gy | 65% | 65M deaths |
| 0.8 (high) | 5-6 Gy | 74% | 74M deaths |
| 1.0 (lethal) | 6+ Gy | 80% | 80M deaths |

**Symptoms by Dose (Research):**
- **1-2 Gy:** Nausea, fatigue, low white blood cell count (survivable with medical care)
- **3-4 Gy:** Severe nausea, hair loss, hemorrhaging (50% mortality without treatment)
- **5-6 Gy:** Overwhelming systemic failure (75% mortality even with treatment)
- **6+ Gy:** Death within weeks (80-100% mortality, no effective treatment)

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Hiroshima:** ~70,000 acute radiation deaths
- **Chernobyl:** 31 acute deaths (firefighters, plant workers)
- **Nuclear war scenario (1000 warheads):** 300-800M acute deaths

---

### 2. Long-Term Cancer Effects

**Timeframe:** Years 5-40 (latency → peak → decline)

**Medical Basis:** Radiation damages DNA, causing elevated cancer rates for decades.

**Cancer Timeline:**

```
Year 0-5: No cancer (latency period, DNA damage accumulating)
Year 5-10: Cancer begins (leukemia first, solid tumors later)
Year 10-20: Rising incidence (exponential growth)
Year 20-30: PEAK incidence (Gaussian curve peaks at ~25 years)
Year 30-40: Declining incidence (most susceptible already dead)
Year 40+: Return to near-baseline
```

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Gaussian curve: peaks at ~0.5 (25 years after exposure)
const yearsIntoCancerRisk = yearsSinceExposure - latencyYears;
const normalizedTime = yearsIntoCancerRisk / (durationYears - latencyYears);
const gaussianFactor = Math.exp(-Math.pow((normalizedTime - 0.5) * 3, 2));

// Monthly cancer deaths
const annualCancerDeaths = exposedPopulation * radiationBonus * gaussianFactor;
const monthlyDeaths = annualCancerDeaths / 12;
```

**Example: 100M Exposed, 30% Radiation Bonus**

| Year | Gaussian Factor | Annual Cancer Deaths | Cumulative |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|------------|
| 5 | 0.04 | 120K | 120K |
| 10 | 0.30 | 900K | 3.0M |
| 15 | 0.78 | 2.34M | 10.2M |
| 20 | 0.96 | 2.88M | 20.4M |
| **25** | **1.00** | **3.0M** (peak) | **30.4M** |
| 30 | 0.96 | 2.88M | 40.4M |
| 35 | 0.78 | 2.34M | 48.2M |
| 40 | 0.30 | 900K | 51.6M |

**Total Cancer Deaths: ~51.6M over 40 years** (51.6% of exposed population)

**Cancer Types (Research):**
- **Leukemia:** Appears first (5-7 years), peaks early
- **Thyroid cancer:** High in children exposed (iodine-131)
- **Breast cancer:** Elevated in women
- **Lung cancer:** Elevated in all exposed
- **Stomach/colon cancer:** Long latency (15-20 years)

---

### 3. Birth Defects Across Generations

**Timeframe:** 3 generations (~75 years)

**Mechanism:** Radiation damages germ cells (sperm/egg), causing genetic defects in children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Which generation are we in?
const currentGeneration = Math.floor(yearsSinceExposure / generationDuration); // 25 years/gen

// Birth rate: ~1% of population has children per year
const annualBirths = exposedPopulation * 0.01;

// Defect rate decreases with each generation (genetic repair)
const generationMultiplier = 1.0 / Math.pow(1.5, currentGeneration);
// Gen 0: 1.0x, Gen 1: 0.67x, Gen 2: 0.44x

const effectiveMultiplier = radiationMultiplier * generationMultiplier;
const annualDefects = annualBirths * baselineRate * effectiveMultiplier;
```

**Example: 100M Exposed, 3x Radiation Multiplier**

| Generation | Years | Birth Defect Rate | Annual Defects | Cumulative |
|------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Gen 0** (exposed) | 0-25 | 3% × 3x = 9% | 90K/year | 2.25M |
| **Gen 1** (children) | 25-50 | 3% × 2x = 6% | 60K/year | 3.75M |
| **Gen 2** (grandchildren) | 50-75 | 3% × 1.3x = 4% | 40K/year | 4.75M |

**Total Birth Defects: ~4.75M over 75 years** (4.75% of exposed population)

**Defect Types (Research):**
- **Microcephaly:** Small head, developmental delays
- **Congenital heart defects:** Structural heart abnormalities
- **Limb malformations:** Missing/malformed limbs
- **Chromosomal abnormalities:** Down syndrome, Turner syndrome
- **Intellectual disabilities:** Reduced cognitive function

**Hiroshima/Nagasaki Data:**
- 2-3x increase in severe mental retardation
- No statistically significant increase in major birth defects (controversial)
- Possible confounding factors (survivor bias, genetic selection)

**Chernobyl Data:**
- 4-5x increase in thyroid cancer in children
- Elevated rates of birth defects in Belarus/Ukraine
- Controversial (attribution difficult, small sample sizes)

---

### 4. Environmental Contamination

**Timeframe:** 30-300+ years (isotope-dependent)

**Key Isotopes:**

| Isotope | Half-Life | Health Risk | Environmental Impact |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Iodine-131** | 8 days | Thyroid cancer (children) | Water contamination (short-term) |
| **Cesium-137** | 30 years | Internal contamination | Soil/plants (long-term dominant) |
| **Strontium-90** | 29 years | Bone cancer, leukemia | Bioaccumulates in bones |
| **Plutonium-239** | 24,000 years | Lung cancer (inhalation) | Extremely persistent |

**Contamination Decay:**

```typescript
// N(t) = N₀ × (1/2)^(t/t_half)
function calculateRadioactiveDecay(initialLevel, timeElapsed, halfLife) {
  return initialLevel * Math.pow(0.5, timeElapsed / halfLife);
}

// Cesium-137 dominates long-term contamination (30-year half-life)
const contaminationLevel = calculateRadioactiveDecay(1.0, monthsSinceExposure, 360);
```

**Contamination Timeline:**

| Years | Half-Lives | Contamination Level | Agriculture? | Water Safe? |
|-------|------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 | 100% | **No** | **No** |
| 10 | 0.33 | 79% | **No** | **No** |
| 30 | 1.0 | **50%** | **No** | Partial |
| 60 | 2.0 | 25% | Risky | Yes |
| 90 | 3.0 | 12.5% | Possible | Yes |
| 100 | 3.3 | 10% | **Yes** | Yes |
| 300 | 10.0 | 0.1% | Safe | Safe |

**Agriculture Threshold:** Contamination < 20% (80% decay = ~70 years)

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Chernobyl Exclusion Zone:** Still contaminated 39 years later (2025)
- **Fukushima Exclusion Zone:** Gradual reopening after 14 years (difficult return)
- **Nevada Test Site:** 900+ nuclear tests, contaminated for centuries

---

### 5. Radioactive Decay

**Physics:** Exponential decay following half-life formula: **N(t) = N₀ × (1/2)^(t/t_half)**

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Example: Cesium-137 (30-year half-life)
const halfLife = 360; // 30 years in months
const monthsElapsed = 360; // 30 years elapsed
const contamination = 1.0 * Math.pow(0.5, 360 / 360); // = 0.5 (50%)
```

**Multi-Isotope Mix:**

```typescript
// Water contamination (mix of isotopes)
const cesiumContamination = calculateRadioactiveDecay(1.0, months, 360);
const iodineContamination = calculateRadioactiveDecay(1.0, months, 0.27);
const waterContamination = (cesiumContamination * 0.7 + iodineContamination * 0.3);
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Iodine-131:** Decays in weeks → acute thyroid risk
- **Cesium-137/Strontium-90:** Persist for decades → long-term land contamination
- **Plutonium-239:** Persists for millennia → permanent exclusion zones

---

### 6. Regional Effects

**Localized Exposure:** Nuclear strikes affect only the target region, not the entire world.

**Example: US-Russia Exchange**

| Region | Strikes | Exposed Population | Contamination | Unaffected Regions |
|--------|---------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Asia** | Russia targeted | 1.2B (30% of Asia) | 100% | China, India, Southeast Asia |
| **North America** | US targeted | 450M (90% of NA) | 100% | Mexico, Canada partial |
| **Europe** | Partial strikes | 200M (30% of Europe) | 50% | Southern Europe mostly safe |
| **Africa** | None | 0 | 0% | **Completely unaffected** ✅ |
| **South America** | None | 0 | 0% | **Completely unaffected** ✅ |
| **Oceania** | None | 0 | 0% | **Completely unaffected** ✅ |

**Global vs Regional:**
- **Nuclear Winter:** Global atmospheric effects (everyone suffers crop failure)
- **Radiation:** Regional effects (Africa untouched by Asia-NA war)

This distinction is **critical for realism**—a Moscow-Washington exchange doesn't irradiate the Amazon rainforest.

- **Phase 3 (3-6 weeks):** Bone marrow failure, hemorrhaging, infections
- **Phase 4 (6+ weeks):** Recovery or death

---

### Hiroshima/Nagasaki Longitudinal Studies

**Source:** Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), 70+ years of data

**Key Findings:**
- **Acute deaths:** ~70,000 Hiroshima, ~40,000 Nagasaki
- **Leukemia:** Peak incidence 5-7 years post-exposure
- **Solid tumors:** Elevated risk for 40+ years
- **Excess cancers:** ~10% of deaths in exposed cohort
- **Birth defects:** No statistically significant increase (controversial)

**Limitations:**
- Low-dose exposure (most died from blast, not radiation)
- Survivor bias (sickest died immediately)
- Single-point exposure (not fallout)

---

### Chernobyl Long-Term Health Effects

**Source:** WHO, IAEA, Ukrainian health ministry (1986-2025)

**Key Findings:**
- **Acute deaths:** 31 (firefighters, plant workers)
- **Thyroid cancer:** 5,000+ cases in children (iodine-131)
- **Leukemia:** Slight increase in exposed workers
- **Solid tumors:** ~1% increase in exposed populations
- **Birth defects:** Controversial, confounded by reporting changes

**Environmental:**
- **Exclusion zone:** Still contaminated 39 years later
- **Cesium-137:** Dominant long-term isotope
- **Agriculture:** Restricted in 5,000 km² area
- **Wildlife:** Thriving (absence of humans > radiation harm)

---

### Fukushima Contamination Data

**Source:** Japanese government, IAEA (2011-2025)

**Key Findings:**
- **Acute radiation deaths:** 0 (evacuation successful)
- **Cancer deaths:** None confirmed yet (5-year latency)
- **Exclusion zone:** Gradual reopening, controversial
- **Decontamination:** $300B spent, limited effectiveness
- **Psychological impact:** Massive (fear > actual risk)

**Environmental:**
- **Ocean contamination:** Tritium released, diluted
- **Soil contamination:** Cs-137 persists
- **Agriculture:** Restricted in 370 km² area

---

## Integration

### Input Dependencies

1. **Nuclear War Trigger** (`src/simulation/extinctions.ts:481`)
   - When nuclear war occurs, radiation exposure events created
   - Exposed population: 30% of world in nuclear regions
   - Each strike represents ~15% exposure

```typescript
const exposedPopulation = state.humanPopulationSystem.totalPopulation * 0.15;
triggerRadiationExposure(state.radiationSystem, state.currentMonth, targetRegion, exposedPopulation, 1.0);
```

2. **Regional Targeting**
   - Russia strike → Asia region contaminated
   - US strike → North America region contaminated
   - Europe strike → Europe region contaminated
   - Other regions unaffected

---

### Output Effects

**Current (Acute Only):**
- ✅ Acute deaths added to `totalRadiationDeaths`
- ✅ Contaminated regions tracked

**Missing (Long-Term Effects):**
- ❌ No monthly update phase (cancer deaths not accruing)
- ❌ No population reduction from long-term cancer
- ❌ No birth defect tracking
- ❌ No contamination decay over time
- ❌ No agricultural restrictions from contamination

---

### Cross-System Integration

**Intended Integration (Not Implemented):**

1. **Population Dynamics**
   - Monthly cancer deaths reduce population
   - Birth defects reduce birth rate
   - Contaminated regions lose population (migration)

2. **Food Security**
   - Contaminated regions: agriculture impossible
   - Food security penalty based on contaminated farmland %
   - Recovery only after contamination < 20%

3. **Quality of Life**
   - Cancer deaths reduce QoL (family suffering)
   - Birth defects reduce QoL (genetic damage)
   - Environmental contamination reduces QoL (fear, displacement)

4. **Regional Biodiversity**
   - High contamination damages ecosystems
   - Recovery only after decades of decay

---

## Parameter Tuning

### Acute Radiation Syndrome Parameters

```typescript
// Dose-response relationship
const BASE_MORTALITY = 0.5;           // 50% at 4 Gy
const DOSE_MULTIPLIER = 0.3;          // +30% at 6+ Gy (total 80%)

const arsMortalityRate = BASE_MORTALITY + (exposureLevel * DOSE_MULTIPLIER);
```

**Tuning Notes:**
- **50% baseline:** Matches 4 Gy LD50 (lethal dose, 50%)
- **80% maximum:** Matches 6+ Gy near-certain death
- **Linear scaling:** Simplified (actual response is sigmoidal, but close enough)

---

### Cancer Risk Parameters

```typescript
// Cancer baseline and radiation bonus
const BASELINE_CANCER_RATE = 0.40;    // 40% lifetime cancer risk (normal)
const MIN_RADIATION_BONUS = 0.10;     // +10% at low exposure
const MAX_RADIATION_BONUS = 0.30;     // +30% at high exposure

const radiationCancerBonus = MIN_RADIATION_BONUS + (exposureLevel * 0.20);
```

**Tuning Notes:**
- **40% baseline:** Matches US/developed world cancer rates
- **+10-30% bonus:** Conservative (Hiroshima data suggests +10-15%, we use higher for worst-case)
- **Latency 5 years:** Matches medical data (leukemia appears first)
- **Peak 25 years:** Matches Hiroshima peak solid tumor incidence
- **Duration 40 years:** Matches observed elevated risk window

---

### Birth Defect Parameters

```typescript
// Birth defects
const BASELINE_BIRTH_DEFECT_RATE = 0.03;  // 3% normal rate
const MIN_MULTIPLIER = 2.0;               // 2x at low exposure
const MAX_MULTIPLIER = 5.0;               // 5x at high exposure

const birthDefectMultiplier = MIN_MULTIPLIER + (exposureLevel * 3.0);
```

**Tuning Notes:**
- **3% baseline:** Matches global birth defect rates
- **2-5x multiplier:** Conservative (Hiroshima data inconclusive, Chernobyl suggests 2-3x, we use higher for worst-case)
- **3 generations:** Matches genetic repair timeline
- **Decreasing each generation:** 1.0x → 0.67x → 0.44x (genetic repair)

---

### Contamination Parameters

```typescript
// Isotope half-lives (physics-based, not tunable)
const CESIUM_137_HALF_LIFE = 360;     // 30 years in months
const STRONTIUM_90_HALF_LIFE = 348;   // 29 years in months
const IODINE_131_HALF_LIFE = 0.27;    // 8 days in months

// Agriculture threshold
const AGRICULTURE_THRESHOLD = 0.20;    // Can farm when < 20% contamination
```

**Tuning Notes:**
- **Half-lives:** Physics constants, cannot tune
- **Agriculture threshold (20%):** Based on Chernobyl data (restricted zones at ~15-30% original contamination)
- **Recovery timeline (100 years):** Optimistic (assumes decontamination efforts, not pure decay)

## Code Structure

### Core Files

**1. Type Definitions** (`src/types/radiation.ts`, 354 lines)

**Key Functions:**

```typescript
// Initialize empty system
export function initializeRadiationSystem(): RadiationSystem

// Create exposure event
export function createRadiationExposure(
  month: number,
  region: string,
  exposedPopulation: number,
  exposureLevel: number = 1.0
): RadiationExposureEvent

// Progress exposure by one month (returns deaths and birth defects)
export function progressRadiationExposure(
  exposure: RadiationExposureEvent,
  currentMonth: number,
  globalPopulation: number
): { deaths: number; birthDefects: number }

// Check if exposure still active
export function isRadiationExposureActive(
  exposure: RadiationExposureEvent,
  currentMonth: number
): boolean

// Update entire system (all active exposures)
export function updateRadiationSystem(
  system: RadiationSystem,
  currentMonth: number,
  globalPopulation: number
): { deaths: number; birthDefects: number }

// Trigger new exposure (called during nuclear war)
export function triggerRadiationExposure(
  system: RadiationSystem,
  month: number,
  region: string,
  exposedPopulation: number,
  exposureLevel: number = 1.0
): RadiationExposureEvent

// Get statistics for logging

triggerRadiationExposure(state.radiationSystem, state.currentMonth, targetRegion, exposedPopulation, 1.0);
```

## Integration Complete (October 14, 2025)

### ✅ FIXED: Monthly Update Phase Integrated

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Fix Implemented:** Created `RadiationSystemPhase` and integrated with population/food/QoL systems.

**Files Created/Modified:**
1. **`src/simulation/engine/phases/RadiationSystemPhase.ts`** (NEW - 135 lines)
   - Monthly updates for all active radiation exposures
   - Cancer death accrual (years 5-40, peak at year 25)
   - Birth defect tracking (3 generations)
   - Contamination decay (exponential half-life formula)
   - Integration with food security and QoL

2. **`src/simulation/engine/phases/index.ts`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added `RadiationSystemPhase` export

3. **`src/simulation/engine.ts`** (MODIFIED)
   - Imported `RadiationSystemPhase`
   - Registered phase in orchestrator (order: 252.5, after NuclearWinterPhase)

4. **`src/types/population.ts`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added `birthDefectsCount` field to `HumanPopulationSystem` interface

**Functionality Now Working:**
- ✅ Acute deaths counted immediately
- ✅ **Cancer deaths accrue monthly** (years 5-40)
- ✅ **Birth defects accumulate** (3 generations, 75 years)
- ✅ **Contamination decays** exponentially (Cs-137 half-life: 30 years)
- ✅ **Contaminated regions reduce food security** (agriculture impossible > 20% contamination)
- ✅ **Cancer epidemic reduces QoL** (healthcare burden, psychological trauma)
- ✅ **Population deaths tracked** (war category, since radiation is consequence of nuclear war)

**Integration Example:**
```typescript
// Month 0: Nuclear strike triggers radiation exposure
triggerRadiationExposure(system, 0, 'Asia', 0.1, 1.0); // 100M exposed

// Months 1-60: RadiationSystemPhase updates monthly
// → Contamination decays
// → Birth defects accumulate
// → No cancer yet (latency period)

// Months 60-480 (Years 5-40): Cancer deaths
// → 50K-900K deaths/month (peak at year 25)
// → Population reduced
// → QoL impacted
// → Food security reduced (contaminated farmland)
```

### Remaining Enhancements (Medium Priority)

**1. Healthcare System Dependency**
- Cancer survival depends on functional hospitals
- ARS treatment requires medical resources
- Collapsed healthcare → higher mortality
- **Status:** Not implemented (current: no healthcare modifier)

**2. Population Migration from Contamination**
- Contaminated regions should trigger refugee crises
- 10-30% of population attempts evacuation
- Neighboring regions face overcrowding
- **Status:** Not implemented (current: population stays in irradiated zones)

**3. Psychological Effects Refinement**
- Radiation fear reduces QoL even at safe levels
- Social trauma from cancer epidemic
- Generational trauma from birth defects
- **Status:** Partially implemented (QoL reduction exists, but not fear-based)

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority (Fix Critical Bug)

**1. Create RadiationSystemPhase**
- Monthly updates for all active exposures
- Cancer deaths accrual (years 5-40)
- Birth defects tracking
- Contamination decay

**2. Integrate with Population Dynamics**
- Cancer deaths reduce population
- Birth defects reduce birth rate
- Track radiation deaths separately

**3. Link Contamination to Food Security**
- Contaminated regions: agriculture impossible
- Food security penalty based on contaminated farmland %
- Recovery only after 70-100 years

---

### Medium Priority

**4. Healthcare System Dependency**
- Cancer survival depends on functional hospitals
- ARS treatment requires medical resources
- Collapsed healthcare → higher mortality

**5. Population Migration**
- Contaminated regions trigger refugee crises
- 10-30% of population attempts evacuation
- Neighboring regions face overcrowding

**6. Psychological Effects**
- Radiation fear reduces QoL (even at safe levels)
- Social trauma from cancer epidemic
- Generational trauma from birth defects

---

### Lower Priority

**7. Dose Heterogeneity**
- Not everyone gets same exposure
- Distance from blast: 100% → 10% over 50km
- Sheltering effectiveness varies

**8. Isotope-Specific Health Effects**
- Iodine-131: Thyroid cancer (children)
- Cesium-137: Internal contamination (all ages)
- Strontium-90: Bone cancer (specific)
- Plutonium-239: Lung cancer (inhalation)

**9. Decontamination Efforts**
- Tech deployment to speed up cleanup
- Cost vs effectiveness trade-offs
- Limited success (Fukushima spent $300B, still contaminated)
