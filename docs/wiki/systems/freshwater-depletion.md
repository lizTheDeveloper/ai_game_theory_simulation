**Status:** ✅ Implemented (TIER 1.2)
**Phase:** FreshwaterPhase (25.0)

## Overview

Models freshwater scarcity - the **#1 resource constraint for civilization**. Tracks groundwater depletion, "Day Zero Droughts", peak groundwater, and regional water stress. Unlike phosphorus (which can be recycled), groundwater takes **centuries to recharge** once depleted.

### Why Critical

- **Non-renewable:** Groundwater takes 100-1000 years to recharge
- **68% of water loss is groundwater** (irreversible on human timescales)
- **41% of humans already in water-stressed basins** (WWF 2024)
- **368 billion metric tons/year loss** (LA Times 2025)
- **Agriculture uses 70%** of global water supply
- **Real crisis examples:**
  - Cape Town (2018): "Day Zero" - 3 months from shutting off taps
  - India (2019): 600M people severe water stress
  - California Central Valley: 2 feet of land subsidence from groundwater pumping
  - Middle East: Ancient aquifers drained in decades

## Mechanics

### 1. Groundwater Depletion

**The Core Crisis:**
- 68% of global water loss is groundwater (Nature 2023)
- Non-renewable on human timescales (100-1000 year recharge)
- Currently declining >0.5 m/year in dry croplands

**Depletion Drivers:**
```typescript
groundwaterDepletion = baseRate * economicStage * agriculturalMultiplier * climateStress * (1 - techEfficiency);
```

**Key Factors:**
- **Economic growth:** More development = more water extraction
- **Agricultural demand:** 70% of use, scales with food needs
- **Climate stress:** Droughts increase pumping desperation
- **Technology:** Precision irrigation reduces waste by 30%

**Natural Recharge:**
- Extremely slow: 0.1%/month maximum
- Aquifer recharge takes decades to centuries
- Cannot keep up with extraction rates

---

### 2. Peak Groundwater

**Concept:** Like "peak oil" but for water. After peak, extraction becomes impossible/uneconomical.

**Trigger:** Groundwater reserves < 50%

**Effects:**
- 30% forced cut in agricultural water use
- Food production declines
- Regional agriculture collapses
- Desperate search for alternatives

**Real-World Evidence:**
- California Central Valley: Land sinking 2 feet from over-pumping
- Northern China Plain: Water table dropping 3 meters/year
- Middle East: Ancient fossil aquifers depleted in 40 years
- AGU 2025 research: "Peak groundwater" already reached in some regions

---

### 3. Day Zero Droughts

**What is Day Zero?**
- Compound extremes: All three conditions present simultaneously
  1. **Low rainfall** (soil moisture < 40%)
  2. **Reduced river flow** (surface water < 50%)
  3. **High consumption** (water stress > 60%)

**Trigger Probability:**
- All three conditions: 10%/month
- Two conditions: 3%/month
- One condition: 0% (single extremes manageable)

**Effects:**
- Duration: 12-36 months
- Severity: 70-100%
- Regional impacts:
  - Material abundance drops 8%
  - Health drops 5%
  - Social trust drops 4%
  - Economic growth rate drops 3%

**Ongoing Impacts:**
- Material abundance declines 1.5%/month (food shortages)
- Damage persists after drought ends

**Real Example:**
- Cape Town 2018: "Day Zero" announced
- 3 months from shutting off municipal water
- 50 liters/person/day ration
- Averted by 50% consumption cuts + desalination

---

### 4. Regional Dynamics

Different regions collapse at different rates based on initial stress and available solutions:

**Middle East (starts 40% stressed)**
- Fastest depletion: 0.8%/month
- Mitigation: Desalination (50% reduction at full deployment)
- Already highly dependent on desalination (Saudi Arabia, UAE)

**North Africa (starts 45% stressed)**
- Moderate depletion: 0.6%/month
- Mitigation: Water recycling (30% reduction)
- Agricultural economy very vulnerable

**South Asia (starts 55% stressed)**
- Agricultural-driven: 0.5%/month
- Mitigation: Precision irrigation (40% reduction)
- 1.8 billion people at risk (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh)

**Global Average**
- Average of all regions + groundwater
- Slower than regional hotspots
- Masks severity of regional crises

---

### 5. Water Stress Calculation

**Formula:**
```typescript
totalSupply = (groundwater + surfaceWater + soilMoisture) / 3;
totalDemand = 1.0 + (economicStage * 0.2);
waterStress = 1.0 - (totalSupply / totalDemand);
```

**Interpretation:**
- 0.0-0.3: Low stress (abundant water)
- 0.3-0.5: Moderate stress (conservation needed)
- 0.5-0.7: High stress (scarcity affecting quality of life)
- 0.7-1.0: Extreme stress (crisis conditions)

**Population Under Stress:**
- Baseline: 41% (WWF 2024 data)
- Scales with water stress: +40% at maximum
- Maximum: 81% of global population

---

### 6. Food System Impact

**Agricultural Dependency:**
- 70% of global water use is agriculture
- Direct link: Water stress → food production → material abundance

**Impact Threshold:** Water stress > 50%
```typescript
foodImpact = (waterStress - 0.50) * 0.012; // Up to 0.6%/month
materialAbundance -= foodImpact;
```

**Cascading Effects:**
1. Groundwater depletes
2. Agricultural irrigation declines
3. Crop yields drop
4. Food prices spike
5. Material abundance falls
6. Social unrest increases
7. Regional collapse spreads

---

### 7. Extinction Pathway

**Type:** Slow collapse (36 months)

**Mechanism:**
1. Groundwater reserves < 15%
2. Water stress > 70%
3. Material abundance < 25% (famine conditions)
4. No alternative water sources deployed (<50% tech adoption)
5. Agricultural system collapses
6. Global famine over 3 years
7. Population decline via starvation

**Prevention:**
- Deploy water technology **before** groundwater hits 15%
- Alternatives must reach 50%+ adoption
- Requires: Desalination + Recycling + Precision Irrigation
- Timeline: 10-15 years to full deployment

## Integration with Other Systems

### Resource Economy
- Water scarcity affects food production capacity
- Material abundance directly impacted
- Economic growth slows during water crises

### Environmental Accumulation
- Climate stress accelerates water depletion
- Droughts increase groundwater pumping
- Positive feedback loop: Climate change → water stress → resource depletion

### Extinction System
- Triggers resource depletion extinction pathway
- Slow collapse (36 months) from agricultural failure
- Population decline via famine

### Breakthrough Technologies
- Tech unlocks require AI capability + research investment
- Auto-deployment based on water stress levels
- Adoption rates vary by technology (desalination fast, AWG slow)

### Phosphorus Depletion
- Both are agricultural resource constraints
- Combined effect: Food production vulnerable to both
- Circular economy solutions overlap (precision ag helps both)

---

## Testing & Validation

**Monte Carlo Results (N=25):**
- Day Zero droughts: 16% of runs (4/25)
- Peak groundwater reached: 8% of runs (2/25)
- Critical scarcity: 4% of runs (1/25)

**Scenarios Tested:**
1. **Business as usual:** Slow depletion, peak groundwater in 2040s
2. **Day Zero drought:** Cape Town scenario → desalination rush
3. **Technology early deployment:** Proactive water recycling → no crisis
4. **Climate accelerated:** High climate stress → faster depletion → forced tech adoption
