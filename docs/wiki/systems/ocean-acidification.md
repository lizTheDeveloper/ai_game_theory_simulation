# Ocean Acidification Crisis System

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (TIER 1.3)
**Phase:** OceanAcidificationPhase (26.0)
**Source:** `src/simulation/oceanAcidification.ts`
**Research:** PIK Potsdam Sept 2025, Stockholm Resilience Centre, Kate Raworth

## Overview

Models ocean acidification - the **7th planetary boundary** that was just breached in September 2025. Tracks aragonite saturation, coral reef collapse, shellfish population decline, and marine food web integrity. This is a **slow-motion extinction** (75 years) affecting 3 billion people who depend on fish for protein.

### Why Critical

- **7th planetary boundary breached** (aragonite saturation < 80% - Sept 2025)
- **3 billion people depend on fish** for primary protein
- **25% of marine species live in coral reefs** (despite reefs being only 0.1% of ocean area)
- **CO2 feedback loop:** Acidification → phytoplankton decline → less CO2 absorption → faster acidification
- **Irreversible timeline:** Ocean chemistry changes persist for thousands of years
- **Real crisis examples:**
  - Pacific Northwest (2005-2007): Oyster hatchery failures, 80% larvae mortality
  - Great Barrier Reef: 50% coral loss since 1995 (heat + acid double hit)
  - Southern Ocean: Pteropods (sea butterflies) shells dissolving at depth

## Mechanics

### 1. Aragonite Saturation Decline

**What is Aragonite?**
- Form of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
- Used by corals and shellfish to build shells/skeletons
- Saturation state: Available aragonite in seawater
- Boundary: 80% (breached Sept 2025 at 78%)

**Decline Rate:**
```typescript
acidificationRate = climateStress * 0.0008 + economicStage * 0.0004 - OAE_deployment * 0.001;
```

**Key Drivers:**
- **Climate instability:** More CO2 emissions → more ocean absorption
- **Economic activity:** Industrial CO2 → ocean acidification
- **Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE):** Can reverse acidification over decades

**Research Basis:**
- pH declining ~0.002 units per decade (0.00017/month)
- Pre-industrial pH: 8.2 → Current: ~8.1 → 2100 projection: ~7.8
- PIK Potsdam (Sept 2025): Aragonite just below 80% threshold

**pH Correlation:**
```typescript
pHLevel = 0.90 + (aragoniteSaturation * 0.10); // Tracks saturation
```

### 2. CO2 Absorption Capacity Feedback

**The Feedback Loop:**
1. Oceans absorb atmospheric CO2 (currently 25% of human emissions)
2. Absorbed CO2 forms carbonic acid → acidification
3. Acidification reduces phytoplankton growth
4. Less phytoplankton = less CO2 absorption
5. More CO2 stays in atmosphere → climate worsens
6. Worse climate = more acidification
7. **Positive feedback loop = runaway effect**

**Mechanics:**
```typescript
absorptionDecline = (1.0 - aragoniteSaturation) * 0.0005;
co2AbsorptionCapacity = Math.max(0.50, co2AbsorptionCapacity - absorptionDecline);

// Feedback to climate system
if (co2AbsorptionCapacity < 0.75) {
  climateStability -= (0.75 - co2AbsorptionCapacity) * 0.0002;
}
```

**Stockholm Resilience Centre:**
- "Degrading oceans' ability to act as Earth's stabiliser"
- Ocean sink declining = atmosphere warming faster
- Irreversible on human timescales (ocean chemistry lasts millennia)

### 3. Coral Reef Collapse

**Timeline:** 2025-2050 (25 years)

**Why Corals Matter:**
- **25% of marine species** live in coral reefs
- Reefs only cover **0.1% of ocean area** (massive biodiversity concentration)
- Provide food, coastal protection, tourism economy
- Support 500+ million people's livelihoods

**Collapse Mechanism:**
```typescript
if (aragoniteSaturation < 0.75) {
  coralDeclineRate = (0.75 - aragoniteSaturation) * 0.015; // Up to 1.5%/month
} else {
  coralDeclineRate = 0.001; // Slow decline from bleaching
}

// Climate stress accelerates (heat + acid = double hit)
coralDeclineRate *= (1.0 + climateStress * 0.5);
```

**Threshold:** Aragonite < 75% = active coral decline

**Double Hit:**
- **Heat stress:** Coral bleaching (symbiont expulsion)
- **Acid stress:** Can't calcify skeleton
- Together: 2x faster decline

**Extinction Phase:** Coral health < 30%
- Irreversible collapse
- 5% instant biodiversity loss
- Cascading ecosystem failures

**Real-World Evidence:**
- Great Barrier Reef: 50% coral loss since 1995
- Caribbean: 80% coral loss since 1970s
- Mass bleaching events: 1998, 2010, 2016, 2020, 2024

**Mitigation:**
- Coral restoration: -40% decline rate at full deployment
- Marine protected areas: -30% decline rate

---

### 4. Shellfish Population Decline

**Timeline:** 2050-2075 (after corals collapse)

**Why Shellfish Matter:**
- Commercial fisheries: Oysters, clams, mussels
- Food web base: Pteropods (sea butterflies) feed fish
- Larvae are most vulnerable (can't form shells)

**Collapse Mechanism:**
```typescript
if (aragoniteSaturation < 0.70) {
  // Critical: Larvae can't form shells
  shellfishDeclineRate = (0.70 - aragoniteSaturation) * 0.012; // Up to 1.2%/month
} else if (aragoniteSaturation < 0.75) {
  // Stressed: Struggling larvae
  shellfishDeclineRate = 0.003; // 0.3%/month
}
```

**Threshold:**
- Aragonite < 75%: Larvae struggling (30% survival)
- Aragonite < 70%: Larvae failing (<10% survival)

**Shellfish Collapse:** Population < 40%
- Oyster/clam/mussel fisheries failing
- 4% material abundance drop (food impact)

**Real-World Evidence:**
- Pacific Northwest (2005-2007): 80% oyster larvae mortality
- Hatcheries pumping alkaline water to save larvae
- $270M/year oyster industry at risk

**Mitigation:**
- Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement: -60% decline rate
- Local hatchery buffering (temporary)

### 5. Marine Food Web Collapse

**Timeline:** 2075-2100 (cascading failure)

**Bottom-Up Extinction:**
1. **Phytoplankton:** Base of food web, declining with acidification
2. **Zooplankton/Pteropods:** Shells dissolving, starving
3. **Small fish:** No food source, populations crash
4. **Large fish:** Prey disappears, apex predators decline
5. **Humans:** 3 billion people lose primary protein source

**Food Web Integrity:**
```typescript
marineFoodWeb = (coralReefHealth + shellfishPopulation + aragoniteSaturation) / 3;
```

**Marine Food Web Collapse:** Integrity < 30%
- 10% instant biodiversity loss
- Catastrophic ecosystem failure

**Fish-Dependent Impact:**
```typescript
if (marineFoodWeb < 0.50) {
  fishDependentImpact = (0.50 - marineFoodWeb) * 2.0; // 0-100% impact

  // 3 billion people (37.5% of 8 billion)
  foodImpact = fishDependentImpact * 0.375 * 0.005; // Up to 0.5%/month
  materialAbundance -= foodImpact;
}
```

**3 Billion People:**
- 37.5% of global population
- Primary protein source: Fish
- Most vulnerable: Coastal developing nations (Africa, Asia, Pacific Islands)

---

### 6. Extinction Pathway

**Type:** Slow collapse (48 months = 4 years)

**Mechanism:**
1. Marine food web collapses (integrity < 30%)
2. Fish-dependent impact > 70% (fisheries failing)
3. Material abundance < 30% (famine conditions)
4. No alternative protein sources (economic stage < 3.5)
5. 3 billion people face starvation
6. Regional collapses cascade globally
7. Population decline over 4 years

**Prevention:**
- Deploy Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement **before** food web collapses
- Develop alternative protein sources (lab-grown meat, plant-based)
- Reach post-scarcity economy (economic stage 3.5+)
- Timeline: 20-30 years to full deployment

## Breakthrough Technologies

### 1. Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE)
**Cost:** $500B (global deployment)
**Effect:** Reverses acidification, sequesters CO2 permanently (10,000 years)
**Timeline:** 5-10 years to deploy
**Research:** Biogeosciences 2025, field tests 2023-2024
**Unlock:** AI capability > 2.5, Total research > 150, Boundary breached

## Parameter Tuning

**Initial State (2025 - Just Breached):**
- Aragonite saturation: 0.78 (below 0.80 boundary)
- pH level: 0.96 (slight decline from pre-industrial)
- CO2 absorption capacity: 0.85 (still strong, declining)
- Coral reef health: 0.65 (already stressed from bleaching)
- Shellfish population: 0.80 (larvae struggling)
- Marine food web: 0.75 (moderately healthy)
- Fish-dependent impact: 0.0 (not yet affecting food supply)

**Crisis Thresholds:**
- Boundary breach: Aragonite < 80% (already breached)
- Coral extinction: Health < 30% (irreversible)
- Shellfish collapse: Population < 40% (fisheries failing)
- Marine food web collapse: Integrity < 30% (catastrophic)
- Extinction pathway: Food web < 30% + Fish impact > 70% + Material abundance < 30%

**Decline Rates:**
- Aragonite: 0.08-0.16%/month (scales with climate + economy)
- CO2 absorption: 0.05%/month (accelerates as saturation drops)
- Coral health: 0.1-1.5%/month (depends on saturation + climate)
- Shellfish: 0.3-1.2%/month (critical below 70% saturation)
- Marine food web: Average of all components

**Technology Deployment:**
- OAE: 1.2%/month (5-year ramp to full deployment)
- Coral restoration: 1.5%/month (aggressive recovery)
- Marine protected areas: 0.8%/month (policy rollout, caps at 30%)

**Feedback Effects:**
- Ocean CO2 buffer declining → climate stability drops 0.02%/month at 75% capacity
- Coral extinction → biodiversity -5% instant
- Marine food web collapse → biodiversity -10% instant

## Testing & Validation

**Monte Carlo Results (N=25):**
- Boundary breached: 100% of runs (starts breached Sept 2025)
- Coral extinction: 12% of runs (3/25)
- Shellfish collapse: 8% of runs (2/25)
- Marine food web collapse: 4% of runs (1/25)
- Extinction via ocean acidification: 0% (OAE deployed in time)
- Mean aragonite at end: 68% (slow decline, below threshold)

**Scenarios Tested:**
1. **Business as usual:** Slow decline, coral extinction by 2050
2. **OAE early deployment:** Acidification reversed, ecosystem recovers
3. **Climate accelerated:** Fast collapse, marine food web fails by 2075
4. **Technology delayed:** Coral extinction locked in, shellfish collapse
