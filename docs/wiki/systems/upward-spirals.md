# Upward Spirals System

**Version:** 2.1
**Last Updated:** October 2025
**Code Reference:** `src/simulation/upwardSpirals.ts`

## Overview

The upward spirals system models **virtuous cascades** - positive feedback loops that make success self-reinforcing. Just as crisis cascades amplify failures (3.0x degradation), upward spirals amplify successes (1.6x improvement).

**Core Mechanic:** When 4+ spirals activate simultaneously, they cross-amplify each other, creating exponential positive growth. This is the **opposite** of cascading failures.

**Utopia Condition:** Requires **3+ sustained spirals for 12+ months** + no active crises. Multiple paths to victory!

## The Six Spirals

### 1. Abundance Spiral 🌾

**Definition:** Material post-scarcity achieved through automation, energy abundance, and time liberation.

**Activation Conditions:**
```typescript
// ALL three required (geometric mean)
const materialAbundance = economicStage >= 3 ? 0.9 : 0.5;
const energyAbundance = energyLevel >= 1.5 ? 0.9 : 0.4;
const timeLiberation = (unemploymentRate >= 0.6 && economicStage >= 3) ? 0.8 : 0.3;

spiralStrength = Math.pow(
  materialAbundance * energyAbundance * timeLiberation,
  1/3
);
```

**Activation Threshold:** 0.6 (all three factors must be strong)

**What It Represents:**
- Food, shelter, energy freely available
- No need to work for survival
- Time to pursue meaning and growth

**Contributing Factors:**
- Economic Stage 3+ (Post-Scarcity)
- High energy production (1.5+ capacity)
- 60%+ unemployment in advanced economy (automation working)

**Effects When Active:**
- Enables Cognitive spiral (time for learning)
- Enables Meaning spiral (time for purpose)
- Boosts QoL: material comfort, time pressure relief

**Common Patterns:**
- Achieved Month 30-50 in successful runs
- Often first spiral to activate
- Gateway to other spirals

  (frameworksDeployment >= 0.3 ? 0.6 : 0.4);

// AI cognitive augmentation
const cognitiveAugmentation =
  (avgCapability >= 1.5 && trustInAI >= 0.6) ?
    0.5 + (avgCapability / 5) : 0.2;

spiralStrength =
  mentalHealthBonus * 0.35 +

  renaissanceStrength >= 0.5) ? 0.9 : 0.5;

spiralStrength =
  (1 - meaningCrisisLevel) * 0.3 +     // Not in meaning crisis
  renaissanceStrength * 0.3 +          // Renaissance active
  communityStrength * 0.25 +           // Community strong
  autonomyScore * 0.15;                // Autonomy & creativity
```

**Activation Threshold:** 0.7 (high bar - meaning is hard!)

- Requires multiple environmental techs deployed
- Can be lost if tech deployment stops
- Easier than Meaning spiral but needs investment

---

## Virtuous Cascade Mechanics

### Activation Threshold

**Trigger:** 4+ spirals active simultaneously

**Why 4?** Creates meaningful strategic choice:
- 3 spirals = Utopia possible (minimum requirement)
- 4 spirals = Virtuous cascade begins
- 6 spirals = Maximum amplification

### Amplification Multipliers

```typescript
if (activeSpiralCount >= 4) {
  let multiplier = 1.0;

  if (activeSpiralCount === 4) multiplier = 1.2;
  if (activeSpiralCount === 5) multiplier = 1.4;
  if (activeSpiralCount === 6) multiplier = 1.6;

  // Applied to:
  // - Research progress
  // - Crisis resolution
  // - QoL improvements
  // - Spiral strength itself (self-reinforcing!)
}
```

**Cascade Levels:**
- **4 spirals:** 1.2x amplification (20% boost)
- **5 spirals:** 1.4x amplification (40% boost)
- **6 spirals:** 1.6x amplification (60% boost)

**What Gets Amplified:**
- Breakthrough tech research speed
- Deployment rates
- Crisis resolution effectiveness
- QoL improvements
- Spiral strength itself (positive feedback!)

### Cascade Logging

```
🌟✨ VIRTUOUS CASCADE BEGINS (Month 62)
   6 upward spirals active → 1.6x amplification
   Active spirals: Abundance, Cognitive, Democratic, Scientific, Meaning, Ecological

   Each spiral reinforces the others:
   • Abundance → Time for Cognitive & Meaning
   • Cognitive → Better Democratic decisions & Scientific progress
   • Democratic → Better governance enables all spirals
   • Scientific → Technologies enable Ecological & Abundance
   • Meaning → Engagement supports Democratic
   • Ecological → Resources support Abundance
```

### Cross-Amplification Examples

**Abundance → Cognitive:**
- Free time enables learning and growth
- No survival stress → better mental health
- Material security → can take risks

**Cognitive → Scientific:**
- Smarter population → better research
- AI augmentation → faster breakthroughs
- Mental health → sustained focus

**Democratic → All Spirals:**
- Better governance → faster tech deployment
- Higher participation → better decisions
- Transparency → trust → engagement

**Scientific → Ecological:**
- Clean Energy → climate + pollution
- Ecosystem Management AI → biodiversity
- Carbon Capture → climate reversal

**Meaning → Democratic:**
- Purpose → civic engagement
- Community → participation
- Cultural adaptation → resilience

**Ecological → Abundance:**
- Sustainable resources → security
- Clean environment → health
- Climate stability → agriculture

## Utopia Condition (NEW)

### Old Condition (WRONG - Pre-Phase 2D)

```typescript
// This was too simple and didn't match the spec
if (goldenAge &&
    noCrises &&
    environmentalSustainability > 0.65 &&
    socialSustainability > 0.65 &&
    technologicalSustainability > 0.65) {
  return Utopia;
}
```

**Problem:** Only one path, no virtuous cascades, ignored spiral system.

### New Condition (CORRECT - Phase 2D+)

```typescript
function canDeclareUtopia(state: GameState): boolean {
  const upwardSpirals = state.upwardSpirals;

  // Count spirals active for 12+ consecutive months
  const sustainedSpirals = upwardSpirals.spirals.filter(
    spiral => spiral.active && spiral.monthsActive >= 12
  ).length;

  // Check for active crises
  const activeCrises = countActiveCrises(state);

  // UTOPIA = 3+ sustained spirals + no crises
  return sustainedSpirals >= 3 && activeCrises === 0;
}
```

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Multiple Paths:** C(6,3) = 20 different combinations of 3 spirals
2. **Sustainability:** Must sustain spirals for 12+ months (not momentary)
3. **Clear Win Condition:** Players see exactly which spirals they achieved
4. **Strategic Depth:** Different strategies for different spiral combinations

### Example Utopia Paths

**Tech Path:**
- Scientific + Cognitive + Abundance
- Strategy: Invest in research, deploy AI, achieve post-scarcity
- Playstyle: Tech-optimist, fast innovation

**Cultural Path:**
- Meaning + Democratic + Cognitive
- Strategy: Build community, maintain democracy, resolve meaning crisis
- Playstyle: Humanist, slow & sustainable

**Eco Path:**
- Ecological + Abundance + Scientific
- Strategy: Environmental tech, resource management, planetary healing
- Playstyle: Green futurist, balance with nature

**Balanced Path:**
- All 6 spirals (maximum amplification)
- Strategy: Comprehensive excellence across all domains
- Playstyle: Perfectionist, hardest but most stable

## Integration Points

### Engine Loop
```typescript
// After governance quality update
updateUpwardSpirals(newState, newState.currentMonth);

// Spirals affect research speed
const researchMultiplier = getVirtuousCascadeMultiplier(newState);
```

### End Game Detection
```typescript
// Utopia check
if (canDeclareUtopia(state)) {
  return { outcome: 'utopia', reason: 'Three upward spirals sustained' };
}
```

### Quality of Life
```typescript
// Spirals boost QoL categories
if (spirals.abundance.active) {
  qol.materialComfort += 0.02;
}
// ... etc for each spiral
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Golden Path (15-20% target)
- **Sequence:** Abundance (Month 40) → Cognitive (Month 55) → Democratic (Month 60) → Scientific (Month 65)
- **Virtuous cascade:** Month 65 (4 spirals)
- **Meaning spiral:** Month 75 (Renaissance kicks in)
- **Ecological spiral:** Month 70 (Tech deployed)
- **Utopia:** Month 85-90 (3+ spirals sustained 12 months)

### Pattern 2: Fast Collapse (40% of runs)
- **Sequence:** Abundance nearly achieved → Crisis cascade → Democratic spiral fails → Authoritarian transition → Dystopia lock-in
- **Failure Point:** Democratic spiral lost before others could activate
- **Lesson:** Democracy is critical, protect it!

### Pattern 3: Technological Plateau (20% of runs)
- **Sequence:** Abundance + Scientific active → Meaning & Ecological missing → Stuck at 2 spirals
- **Issue:** Tech alone insufficient, need cultural adaptation
- **Outcome:** Dystopia (surveillance) or Extinction (environmental)

### Pattern 4: Meaning Crisis Block (30% of runs)
- **Sequence:** 5/6 spirals possible → Meaning spiral never activates → Can't reach Utopia
- **Issue:** Only 1-2 techs help meaning, Renaissance slow to start
- **Phase 2E Fix:** Renaissance system makes Meaning more achievable

## Balance Considerations

### Why 3+ Spirals for Utopia?
- Not too easy (1-2 spirals common even in failed runs)
- Not impossible (20 different combinations possible)
- Requires coordination across multiple domains
- Matches narrative: Utopia needs comprehensive success

### Why 12 Months Sustained?
- Prevents momentary spikes from triggering Utopia
- Requires stability, not just peak performance
- Allows recovery from temporary setbacks
- Matches "Golden Age" 12-month requirement

### Why 4+ for Virtuous Cascade?
- Must achieve more than minimum for amplification
- Creates strategic choice: pursue amplification or just hit threshold
- 1.2x-1.6x range feels impactful but not overpowered

### Why Geometric Mean for Abundance?
- ALL three factors (material, energy, time) must be present
- Can't substitute one for another
- Matches post-scarcity definition (not just wealth OR energy)

### Why 0.6-0.7 Activation Thresholds?
- Low enough to be achievable (50% = too easy, 80% = too hard)
- High enough to require real investment
- Different thresholds for different spirals (Meaning hardest at 0.7)

---

## Testing & Results

**Pre-Implementation (Phase 2C):**
- Utopia: 0%
- Dystopia: 60%
- Extinction: 40%
- No virtuous cascades
- No spiral tracking

**Post-Implementation (Phase 2D):**
- Utopia: 0% (still - spirals not activating!)
- Dystopia: 60%
- Extinction: 40%
- Virtuous cascades: **0 observed**
- Spiral activation: **Very rare**

**Root Cause (Diagnosed):**
- **Scientific spiral:** Never activating (deployment too slow)
- **Meaning spiral:** Rarely activating (only 1 tech helps)
- **Ecological spiral:** Sometimes activating (but late)
- **Abundance/Cognitive/Democratic:** Activating but alone

**Phase 2E-2F Fixes:**
- Meaning Renaissance (4 dimensions, not just 1 tech)
- AI-accelerated deployment (faster tech scaling)
- Expected result: 10-20% Utopia rate

3. **Regional Spirals**
   - Some regions achieve spirals, others don't
   - Migration dynamics (people move to Utopia regions)
   - Spillover effects

4. **Narrative Branching**
   - Different spiral combinations → different Utopia "flavors"
   - Tech Utopia vs Cultural Utopia vs Eco Utopia
   - Unique ending text for each path

5. **Player Strategies**
   - "Spiral Focus" mechanic: invest extra in one spiral
   - Trade-offs: specialize or balance?
   - Mini-goals: "Activate 3 spirals by Month 60"
