# üåç Planetary Boundaries System (TIER 3.1)

**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (October 12, 2025)  
**Research Base:** Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics (2012-2025) + Stockholm Resilience Centre (2023-2025)  
**Implementation:** `src/simulation/planetaryBoundaries.ts`, `src/types/planetaryBoundaries.ts`

---

## üìã Overview

The **Planetary Boundaries System** implements Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics framework, tracking the 9 planetary boundaries that define Earth's "safe operating space" for humanity. This system models **cascading feedback loops** between boundaries that can trigger **irreversible tipping points** leading to extinction.

### Key Insight (Kate Raworth):
> "It's not about the 'worst' crisis - it's about cascading, reinforcing feedback loops between boundaries. Breach multiple ‚Üí tipping points ‚Üí non-linear, irreversible change ‚Üí extinction."

## üî• Core Boundaries

Two boundaries are designated as **"core boundaries"** because they interact with ALL other boundaries:

1. **Climate Change** - Affects water, land, biodiversity, oceans, everything
2. **Biosphere Integrity (Biodiversity)** - Ecosystem collapse cascades to all systems

**Current Status:** ‚ùå **Both core boundaries are breached** ‚Üí Amplifies tipping point risk by +50%

---

## üìä System Mechanics

### 1. Boundary Tracking

Each boundary has:
- **Current Value:** `[0, 2]` where 1.0 = boundary threshold
- **Status:** `safe`, `beyond_boundary`, `increasing_risk`, `high_risk`
- **Trend:** `improving`, `stable`, `worsening`
- **Reversibility:** Can we recover? (Most boundaries are irreversible)
- **Timescale:** How fast does it change (1-100 years)
- **Extinction Contribution:** `[0, 1]` How much contributes to extinction risk

### 2. Dynamic Updates

Boundaries update based on simulation state:
- **Climate Change:** Driven by environmental climate stability
- **Biosphere:** Driven by biodiversity index
- **Freshwater:** Driven by freshwater system (water stress)
- **Biogeochemical:** Driven by phosphorus depletion
- **Novel Entities:** Driven by environmental pollution
- **Ocean Acidification:** Driven by ocean acidification system
- **Ozone:** Improving +0.06%/year (Montreal Protocol recovery)
- **Aerosols:** Improving +0.036%/year (air quality regulations)

### 3. Tipping Point Risk Calculation (Non-Linear)

**Risk Curve:**
```
0 breached: 0% risk
3 breached: 10% risk
5 breached: 30% risk
7 breached (NOW): 60% risk  ‚Üê We are here
9 breached: 95% risk (near-certain cascade)
```

**Amplifiers:**
- ‚úÖ **Core boundaries breached:** +50% risk (climate + biosphere)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High-risk boundaries:** +8% per boundary far beyond threshold
- üìâ **Worsening trends:** +3% per boundary getting worse

**Current 2025 Risk:** ~60-70% base + amplifiers = **~80% tipping point risk**

### 4. Cascade Trigger

When `tippingPointRisk > 70%`:
- **10% chance per month** of triggering irreversible cascade
- Once triggered, **cannot be stopped**
- Leads to **extinction in 48 months** (4 years)

---

## üå™Ô∏è Tipping Point Cascade Effects

### Immediate Impacts (Month 1):
- **Climate Stability:** -15% immediate drop
- **Biodiversity:** -20% immediate crash
- **Freshwater Stress:** +25% surge
- **Ocean Acidification:** +12% surge
- **Pollution:** +10% surge

### Quality of Life Collapse:
- **Food Security:** -25%
- **Healthcare Quality:** -15%
- **Social Cohesion:** -20%

### Ongoing Degradation (Per Month):
- **Environmental Decay:** -2% per month (cumulative)
- **QoL Decay:** -1.5% per month (cumulative)
- **Population Deaths:** 2% mortality per month

### Timeline:
```
Month 0:  Cascade triggers
Month 12: 50% environmental collapse, 20% population loss
Month 24: 75% environmental collapse, 40% population loss
Month 36: 90% environmental collapse, 60% population loss
Month 48: Complete Earth system breakdown, 100% extinction probability
```

## ‚ú® Success Story: Ozone Layer Recovery

The **stratospheric ozone boundary** is one of only 2 safe boundaries, and it's **actively improving**!

### Montreal Protocol (1987)
- Phased out nearly **100 ozone-depleting substances**
- CFCs (refrigeration, aerosols), Halons (fire suppression)
- **2024:** Ozone hole 7th smallest since recovery began (1992)
- **Projected:** Full recovery by **2066**

### Why This Matters:
- **PROOF THAT GLOBAL POLICY WORKS!**
- Shows humanity CAN cooperate to solve planetary-scale crises
- Provides template for climate action

**Research Backing:**
- WMO (Sept 2025): Ozone recovery confirmed
- NOAA/NASA (Oct 2024): On track for 2066 recovery
- MIT (March 2025): Direct result of global efforts

## üéì Educational Value

### Real-World Lessons:
1. **Systems Thinking:** Everything is connected
2. **Non-Linear Dynamics:** Small changes can trigger big shifts
3. **Tipping Points:** Some changes are irreversible
4. **Policy Success:** Montreal Protocol shows cooperation works
5. **Urgency:** We're already at 7/9 boundaries breached

### Discussion Questions:
- Why are 2 core boundaries (climate + biosphere) so critical?
- What does it mean that ozone is recovering but 7 others are worsening?
- Can we reverse tipping points once triggered?
- What policy changes could move boundaries back to safe zone?
