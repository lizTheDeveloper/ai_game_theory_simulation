# ðŸ”¬ Breakthrough Technologies System

**Module:** `src/simulation/breakthroughTechnologies.ts`
**Purpose:** Research, unlock, and deploy transformative technologies that can prevent or reverse crises
**Status:** âœ… Fully Implemented (October 2025)

## Overview

The Breakthrough Technologies System provides recovery and prevention pathways for the accumulation crises. It models how AI-accelerated research can unlock transformative technologies that address environmental degradation, social cohesion erosion, and other systemic problems.

**Key Insight:** Technological breakthroughs are the escape valve. Without them, crisis cascades are nearly inevitable. With strategic investment, crises can be prevented or reversed.

## System Architecture

### Technology Lifecycle

```
1. RESEARCH PHASE
   â”œâ”€ Government allocates research budget (environmental/social/medical)
   â”œâ”€ Private organizations contribute (safety-focused orgs contribute more)
   â”œâ”€ Progress accumulates probabilistically (AI capability Ã— budget)
   â””â”€ Prerequisites must be met (tech tree dependencies)

2. UNLOCK
   â”œâ”€ Research reaches 100%
   â”œâ”€ Technology unlocks
   â””â”€ Deployment begins at 10%

3. DEPLOYMENT PHASE
   â”œâ”€ Government continues investing (deployment budget)
   â”œâ”€ Deployment increases 5-15% per month (depending on budget + crisis urgency)
   â”œâ”€ EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT: 3x faster during relevant crises
   â””â”€ Reaches 100% over 6-20 months

4. EFFECTS ACTIVE
   â”œâ”€ Monthly effects scale with deployment level
   â”œâ”€ Environmental: pollution reduction, climate stabilization, etc.
   â”œâ”€ Social: meaning crisis reduction, cohesion strengthening
   â””â”€ Medical: QoL boosts (healthcare, trust)

5. CRISIS RESOLUTION
   â”œâ”€ Technologies reverse accumulation metrics
   â”œâ”€ When metric crosses resolution threshold â†’ crisis resolves
   â””â”€ Cascade multiplier reduced â†’ QoL recovers
```

### Research Budget Allocation

**Government research budget** is split across three priorities:
- **Environmental** (40% default): Climate, energy, materials
- **Social** (30% default): Mental health, purpose, community
- **Medical** (30% default): Disease, longevity

**Private research contributions** (from organizations):
- Safety-focused orgs contribute ~10% of revenue to breakthrough research
- Profit-focused orgs contribute little
- Contributions increase during crises (crisis response)

**Auto-allocation** (current testing implementation):
- Budget scales with economic stage: $10B (Stage 0) â†’ $30B (Stage 4)
- Splits: 40% env, 30% social, 30% medical
- Will be replaced with strategic government actions

## Crisis Recovery Mechanics

### How Technologies Reverse Crises

**Example: Pollution Crisis**
```
Month 22: Pollution Crisis triggers (pollution 71%)
  â”œâ”€ QoL drops: -0.20 environmental, -0.10 healthcare
  â”œâ”€ Ongoing: -0.01 per month (worsening)
  â””â”€ Cascade contribution: +1 crisis

Month 24: Clean Energy unlocks (with early investment)
  â”œâ”€ Deployment begins at 10%
  â””â”€ Pollution reduction: -0.15% per month (10% Ã— 1.5%)

Month 28: Clean Energy at 30% deployment
  â”œâ”€ Emergency deployment: 3x faster (crisis urgency system)
  â””â”€ Pollution reduction: -0.45% per month

Month 32: Pollution drops to 65%
  â”œâ”€ Still in crisis (threshold is 70%)
  â””â”€ But degradation slowing

Month 36: Clean Energy at 70% deployment
  â”œâ”€ Pollution: 55%
  â””â”€ Below resolution threshold (50%)!

Month 37: âœ… POLLUTION CRISIS RESOLVED
  â”œâ”€ Crisis deactivates
  â”œâ”€ Ongoing degradation stops
  â”œâ”€ Cascade multiplier reduced
  â””â”€ QoL begins recovering
```

### Resolution Thresholds

| Crisis | Trigger | Resolution | Key Technologies |
|--------|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Pollution Crisis** | > 70% | < 50% (< 60% with Clean Energy) | Clean Energy, Recycling |
| **Climate Catastrophe** | < 30% | > 70% (> 60% with both techs) | Carbon Capture + Clean Energy |
| **Ecosystem Collapse** | < 40% | > 60% (> 50% with Ecosystem AI) | Ecosystem Management |
| **Meaning Collapse** | > 70% | < 50% (< 60% with both techs) | Mental Health + Purpose Frameworks |
| **Resource Crisis** | < 40% | > 30% (> 35% with Recycling) | Advanced Recycling |

**Design Philosophy:** Technologies make resolution easier (higher thresholds) but don't guarantee success. You still need sustained deployment.

## Strategic Timing

### Early Investment Path (Prevention)
```
Month 1-15: Invest heavily in environmental tech ($6B/month)
  â”œâ”€ Sustainable Agriculture unlocks Month 18
  â”œâ”€ Community Platforms unlock Month 18
  â””â”€ Clean Energy on track for Month 24

Month 15-30: Continue investment, deploy early techs
  â”œâ”€ Agriculture + Community active, providing mitigation
  â”œâ”€ Clean Energy unlocks Month 24, begins deployment
  â””â”€ Crises don't trigger (accumulation slowed)

Month 30-50: Mid-tier techs unlock
  â”œâ”€ Carbon Capture unlocks Month 40
  â”œâ”€ Ecosystem Management unlocks Month 46
  â””â”€ All environmental crises prevented

Result: No crisis cascade â†’ sustained Golden Age â†’ Utopia path open
```

### Late Investment Path (Recovery)
```
Month 1-20: Minimal environmental investment (focus on AI alignment)
  â”œâ”€ No tech unlocks
  â””â”€ Accumulation unchecked

Month 22-35: Crisis cascade begins
  â”œâ”€ Ecosystem Collapse (Month 22)
  â”œâ”€ Pollution Crisis (Month 28)
  â”œâ”€ Climate Catastrophe (Month 35)
  â””â”€ 3 crises active, 1.5x-2.0x cascade multiplier

Month 35: Panic investment in environmental tech
  â”œâ”€ $10B/month to environmental research
  â””â”€ Emergency response

Month 40: Clean Energy unlocks
  â”œâ”€ Emergency deployment (3x faster due to crises)
  â””â”€ Deployment: 10% â†’ 25% in 5 months

Month 45: Pollution starts declining
Month 50: Pollution crisis resolves
Month 55: Carbon Capture unlocks (very late)
Month 65: Climate catastrophe resolves
Month 70: If society hasn't collapsed â†’ recovery complete

Result: 50/50 whether tech arrives in time. Often too late (cascade â†’ extinction)
```

**Key Lesson:** Prevention >> Recovery. Early investment avoids cascade entirely.

## Government Type Effects

### Democratic Governments
- **No penalties** on any technology
- Baseline research speeds
- Best for social technologies (community, purpose)

### Technocratic Governments
- **30% bonus** on technical solutions (Clean Energy, Fusion, Carbon Capture, Recycling)
- **30% penalty** on social innovation (Purpose Frameworks, Community Platforms)
- Good for environmental crisis prevention
- Struggles with meaning crisis (can't research social solutions effectively)

### Authoritarian Governments
- **Major penalties** on social technologies:
  - Purpose Frameworks: 80% penalty (ideology blocks adaptation)
  - Community Platforms: 70% penalty (surveillance breaks trust)
  - Mental Health AI: 50% penalty (distrust of vulnerability)
- **Neutral** on industrial tech (Clean Energy, Recycling)
- **DYSTOPIA LOCK-IN:** Can't research social tech â†’ meaning crisis worsens â†’ more authoritarianism â†’ even less social research â†’ death spiral

**Critical Implication:** Authoritarian transition (from institutional failure or control response) makes Utopia nearly impossible (can't unlock social techs needed for meaning crisis resolution).

## Emergency Deployment System

**Crisis Urgency Multiplier** (src/simulation/breakthroughTechnologies.ts:169):

When a technology directly addresses an active crisis, deployment accelerates:

```typescript
// Base: $5B for 5% deployment per month
// Emergency: Up to 3x faster during severe crises

if (env.ecosystemCollapseActive && tech.id === 'ecosystemManagement') {
  deploymentRate *= 2.6; // 0.8 urgency Ã— 2 + 1 = 2.6x
}
```

**Technology-Crisis Mapping:**
- Clean Energy: Pollution (0.4) + Climate (0.4) = 0.8 urgency
- Carbon Capture: Climate (0.6) + Pollution (0.2) = 0.8 urgency
- Ecosystem Management: Ecosystem (0.8) + Climate (0.2) = 1.0 urgency (max)
- Mental Health AI: Meaning (0.7) + Social (0.2) = 0.9 urgency
- Purpose Frameworks: Meaning (0.8) = 0.8 urgency

**Effect:** During cascading crises, relevant technologies deploy 2-3x faster (if they've unlocked in time).

## Integration with Other Systems

### Environmental Accumulation
- Technologies directly modify accumulation metrics (pollution, climate, biodiversity)
- Can reverse crises if effects are strong enough
- Resource efficiency multipliers reduce depletion rates

### Social Cohesion
- Social technologies reduce meaning crisis accumulation
- Accelerate cultural adaptation (Purpose Frameworks)
- Strengthen community bonds (Community Platforms)

### Quality of Life
- Medical technologies provide direct QoL boosts (+0.15 to +0.35 healthcare)
- All technologies apply monthly effects scaled by deployment
- Effects calculated in `getTechnologyQoLBoosts()` (breakthroughTechnologies.ts:438)

### Golden Age / Utopia
- Technologies are **required** for sustained Golden Age
- Utopia checks sustainability across all systems (environmental, social, tech)
- Without breakthrough tech: Golden Age â†’ Crisis Cascade â†’ Collapse
- With breakthrough tech: Golden Age â†’ Sustainable Prosperity â†’ Utopia

## Success Metrics

**Target Utopia Rate:** 10-15% of runs (with breakthrough tech system)

**Observed Patterns (testing):**
- Early investment (Month 1-20): 15-20% Utopia
- Mid investment (Month 20-40): 5-10% Utopia
- Late investment (Month 40+): 0-2% Utopia (usually too late)
- No investment: 0% Utopia (crisis cascade inevitable)

**Research Questions:**
- Are unlock times balanced? (Too fast = easy mode, too slow = impossible)
- Is emergency deployment too strong? (Makes late investment viable?)
- Do government penalties create interesting strategic choices?

## Tuning Parameters

| Parameter | Current Value | Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Clean Energy cost | $20B / 24 months | Flagship environmental tech timing |
| Ecosystem Management cost | $40B / 36 months | Ultimate environmental solution timing |
| Purpose Frameworks cost | $10B / 18 months | Social adaptation timing |
| Emergency deployment multiplier | 2-3x | How much crises accelerate deployment |
| Authoritarian social penalty | 50-80% | Dystopia lock-in strength |
| AI capability requirements | 0.5-2.5 | When tech becomes feasible |

**Most impactful for balance:**
- Technology unlock timing (controls when recovery is possible)
- Emergency deployment strength (late investment viability)
- Government penalties (creates path dependencies)
