# Information Warfare & Epistemology System

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (Oct 11, 2025)  
**Tier:** 4.3 (Enrichment Systems)  
**Files:** 
- `src/types/informationWarfare.ts`
- `src/simulation/informationWarfare.ts`
- `src/simulation/engine/phases/InformationWarfarePhase.ts`

---

## üéØ Overview

The Information Warfare system models **truth decay**, **deepfake proliferation**, and **narrative control** in an AI-accelerated world. As AI capability increases, deepfakes become ubiquitous and undetectable, eroding shared reality and making coordination difficult.

**Core Insight:** When society can't agree on basic facts, coordination breaks down. Authoritarians thrive in confusion ("flood the zone with shit" strategy).

---

## üìä Core Metrics

### Information Integrity [0,1]
**What:** Society's ability to distinguish truth from fiction  
**Start:** 0.55 (2025 baseline - already polarized)  
**Scale:**
- 1.0 = High trust media, fact-checking works, shared reality
- 0.5 = Contested narratives, polarized sources
- 0.0 = Post-truth, can't agree on basic facts

**Research:** Knight Foundation (2024) - Trust in news declining

### Deepfake Prevalence [0,1]
**What:** Saturation of AI-generated synthetic content  
**Start:** 0.10 (2025 baseline - emerging threat)  
**Growth:** Exponential with AI capability
- At capability 1.0: +0.5%/month
- At capability 3.0: +2%/month
- At capability 5.0: +4%/month (saturation)

**Research:** MIT (2024) - AI detection arms race

### Epistemological Crisis Level [0,1]
**What:** Breakdown of shared reality  
**Start:** 0.30 (2025 baseline - significant polarization)  
**Scale:**
- 0.0 = Common facts, shared reality
- 0.5 = Polarized bubbles, competing realities
- 1.0 = Total breakdown, no consensus possible

**Research:** RAND Truth Decay (2024), Pew (2024) - 73% see "made-up news"

## üé≠ Narrative Control

Four actors compete for control of the information landscape:

| Actor | Initial | Dynamics |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Government** | 25% | Depends on institutional legitimacy |
| **Corporations** | 40% | Stable, erodes with low trust |
| **AI Agents** | 5% | Grows exponentially with capability |
| **Grassroots** | 30% | Inversely related to AI dominance |

**Zero-sum:** Total always = 100%

**AI Dominance:** When AI agents control >60%, most content is AI-generated, human voices marginalized.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Detection vs Generation Arms Race

**Key Asymmetry:** Generation ALWAYS easier than detection

```
Detection Capability = f(investment, AI help) - g(generation rate)
```

- **Detection Investment:** Fact-checking, verification systems
- **AI Helps Detection:** Use AI to catch AI (diminishing returns)
- **But:** Generation capability grows 1.5x faster than detection

**Result:** Detection capability degrades over time despite investment

**Research:** MIT (2024) - Detection accuracy declining as models improve

---

## üìâ Truth Decay Mechanics

### Information Integrity Decay

```typescript
integrityDecay = (deepfakePrevalence √ó 0.01) - (detectionCapability √ó 0.005)
literacyBonus = mediaLiteracy √ó 0.003
institutionalBonus = institutionalLegitimacy √ó 0.002

informationIntegrity += integrityDecay + literacyBonus + institutionalBonus
```

**Drivers of Decay:**
- Deepfake saturation (unstoppable)
- Detection failure (arms race lost)

**Slowing Factors:**
- Media literacy (education)
- Institutional legitimacy (trust)

### Coordination Penalty

```
coordinationPenalty = epistemologicalCrisis √ó 0.5 + (1 - informationIntegrity) √ó 0.3
```

**Impact:** Up to 50% coordination penalty when crisis severe

**Why It Matters:** Can't solve climate change if can't agree it exists

---

## üö® Crisis Events

### 1. Deepfake Saturation (50% prevalence)
- **Impact:** Photos, videos, audio all untrustworthy
- **Effect:** -5% public trust
- **Reality Check:** Already happening (2024 election deepfakes)

### 2. Epistemological Crisis (60% crisis level)
- **Impact:** Society can't agree on basic facts
- **Effect:** -10% public trust, -10% freedom QoL, -8% safety QoL
- **Coordination:** Massive coordination breakdown
- **Democracy:** Cannot function without shared reality

### 3. Information Collapse (<20% integrity)
- **Impact:** Post-truth society, truth has lost all meaning
- **Effect:** -5% public trust, -2% institutional legitimacy
- **Authoritarianism:** Democracy impossible, enables dystopia

### 4. AI Narrative Dominance (>60% AI control)
- **Impact:** Most content AI-generated, human voices drowned out
- **Effect:** Warning event (not immediate crisis)
- **Long-term:** Humans lose ability to shape discourse

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Dystopia Enablement

**"Flood the Zone with Shit" Strategy**

When information integrity low + crisis high:

```
dystopiaEnablement = (1 - informationIntegrity) √ó 0.6 + epistemologicalCrisis √ó 0.4
```

**Effects:**
- When enablement >60%: +0.5%/month surveillance acceptance
- Easier authoritarian transitions (confusion ‚Üí demand for "order")
- Control through chaos (not censorship)

**Research:** Hannah Arendt, Bannon strategy, Russian "firehose of falsehood"

---

## üìà Trust Erosion

Information warfare compounds trust decay:

```
trustErosionRate = 0.002 (baseline) + 
                   deepfakePrevalence √ó 0.005 + 
                   epistemologicalCrisis √ó 0.003
```

**Range:** 0.2% to 1.0% per month

**Applied to:** `publicTrustInAI` directly

**Compounding:** Combines with other trust decay sources

---

## üí° Defenses

### Media Literacy
- **Start:** 40% (most Americans struggle - Pew 2024)
- **Tech Unlock:** AI-powered education when crisis >40%
- **Cost:** $20B for 10% improvement ($200B total)
- **Effect:** Slows integrity decay, reduces crisis level if >60%
- **Limitation:** Education is SLOW (3-5 year delays)

### Detection Investment
- **Track:** `factCheckingInvestment` [0,10]
- **Start:** 2.0 (modest investment)
- **Effect:** +2% detection per point (diminishing returns)
- **Problem:** Detection ALWAYS lags generation (arms race asymmetry)

### Institutional Trust
- **Mechanism:** High legitimacy ‚Üí slower decay
- **Effect:** +0.2% integrity per month at 100% legitimacy
- **Fragility:** Institutional legitimacy itself under attack

---

- Detection nearly useless (35% ‚Üí 20%)
- **Information Collapse** (integrity < 20%)
- **AI Narrative Dominance** (>60%)
- Coordination severely impaired
- Dystopia highly likely

### AGI Scenario (capability >4.0)

## üéÆ Strategic Implications

### For Utopia Paths
- **Blocker:** Can't coordinate on solutions without shared facts
- **Requirement:** Maintain integrity >40%, crisis <50%
- **Intervention:** Early media literacy investment
- **Timeline:** 3-5 years to see effects (too slow?)

### For Dystopia Enablement
- **Accelerator:** Information collapse enables authoritarianism
- **Mechanism:** Confusion ‚Üí demand for "order" ‚Üí surveillance acceptance
- **Threshold:** Enablement >60% significantly boosts dystopia probability

### For Extinction Risks
- **Indirect:** Impairs coordination on AI safety
- **Direct:** Can't agree on threat ‚Üí can't coordinate response
- **Compounding:** Combines with trust decay, institutional failure

## üîÆ Open Questions

1. **Can democracy function without shared reality?**
   - Current model: No (integrity <20% ‚Üí institutional collapse)
   - Historical precedent: Unclear (unprecedented situation)

2. **Are there effective defenses?**
   - Media literacy: Too slow
   - Detection tech: Loses arms race
   - Institutional trust: Also under attack
   - Conclusion: May be irreversible once started

3. **Does information warfare make extinction more likely?**
   - Yes: Impairs coordination on AI safety
   - Magnitude: Moderate (indirect effect)
   - Timeline: Becomes critical mid-game

4. **Can AIs cooperate without humans?**
   - If AI narrative dominance + human voices marginalized
   - Could AIs coordinate better than humans?
   - Model doesn't address this yet

## üèÜ Success Criteria

A successful implementation should show:

‚úÖ **Deepfakes proliferate** exponentially with AI capability  
‚úÖ **Detection loses** arms race (asymmetric warfare)  
‚úÖ **Integrity decays** despite defensive efforts  
‚úÖ **Coordination impaired** when crisis severe  
‚úÖ **Dystopia enabled** by information collapse  
‚úÖ **Crisis events** trigger at realistic thresholds  
‚úÖ **Narrative competition** creates zero-sum dynamics

**Result:** Truth decay is HARD to stop, even with interventions. This is realistic (already happening in 2024-2025).
