## ðŸŽ¯ Module Responsibilities

### 1. `capabilities.ts` - Multi-Dimensional AI Capabilities (Phase 2.5)
**Purpose:** Manage the multi-dimensional capability profile system

**Functions:**
- `initializeCapabilityProfile()` - Create AI with diverse capability dimensions
- `initializeResearchInvestments()` - Government research budget allocation
- `calculateResearchTotal()` - Aggregate research sub-tree
- `calculateTotalCapabilityFromProfile()` - Backward-compatible total
- `updateDerivedCapabilities()` - Map profile to escape capabilities
- `getIndustryImpact()` - Calculate industry-specific AI impact

**Key Concepts:**
- 7 core dimensions: physical, digital, cognitive, social, economic, selfImprovement, research
- 12 research specializations across 4 domains (biotech, materials, climate, CS)
- Non-uniform growth rates (self-improvement fastest, physical slowest)
- Industry-specific impact calculations

---

### 2. `qualityOfLife.ts` - Multi-Dimensional QoL (Phase 1)
**Purpose:** Track 17 QoL dimensions for nuanced outcome trajectories

**Functions:**
- `calculateQualityOfLife()` - Aggregate 17 dimensions into single score
- `initializeQualityOfLifeSystems()` - Baseline 2025 values
- `updateQualityOfLifeSystems()` - Dynamic updates based on game state

**Key Concepts:**
- 5 categories: Basic Needs (30%), Psychological (25%), Social (20%), Health (15%), Environmental (10%)
- 17 dimensions enable "dark valley" dynamics (some drop, others maintained)
- Material abundance can rise while freedom drops (dystopia path)
- Mental health can drop while material needs met (transition crisis)

---

### 3. `balance.ts` - Game Balance Mechanics
**Purpose:** Core game mechanics that balance threat vs interventions

**Functions:**
- `calculateAICapabilityGrowthRate()` - Recursive self-improvement mechanics
- `calculateAlignmentDrift()` - Goodhart's Law (alignment decay)
- `calculateAlignmentResearchEffect()` - Costly but helpful interventions
- `calculateCumulativeRegulationEffect()` - Stacking regulations
- `calculateComputeGovernanceEffect()` - Compute bottleneck control
- `calculateRacingDynamicsPressure()` - Coordination dilemma

**Key Concepts:**
- Recursive improvement at capability > 1.5 (dangerous zone)
- Alignment drifts as capability increases (moving target problem)
- Regulations slow AI but have diminishing returns
- Compute governance very effective but very costly
- Racing dynamics create pressure to accelerate

---

### 4. `structuralEffects.ts` - Policy Consequences
**Purpose:** Different policies have different long-term structural effects

**Functions:**
- `calculateRegulationStructuralEffects()` - Regulation type consequences
- `calculateUBIVariantEffects()` - UBI variant outcomes
- `calculateEmergentSurveillance()` - Surveillance dynamics

**Key Concepts:**
- Large company regulation: small labs escape (racing dynamics)
- Compute threshold: effective but enables surveillance
- Capability ceiling: hard to enforce, black markets
- Generous UBI: fast adaptation, high cost, opens post-scarcity
- Means-tested: slower adaptation, medium cost
- Job guarantee: very slow adaptation, maintains work paradigm

---

### 5. `outcomes.ts` - Outcome Determination
**Purpose:** Determine which outcome (utopia/dystopia/extinction) is occurring

**Functions:**
- `calculateTotalAICapability()` - Sum across all AI agents
- `calculateAverageAlignment()` - Average alignment score
- `calculateEffectiveControl()` - Government control over AI
- `calculateOutcomeProbabilities()` - Probability distributions
- `determineActualOutcome()` - Check if outcome actually happened

**Key Concepts:**
- **Probabilities â‰  Reality**: 90% extinction probability doesn't mean extinction occurred
- Actual outcomes require concrete conditions (unaligned superintelligence, etc.)
- Heterogeneous extinction system handles all extinctions (Phase 2)
- Dystopia: high control + low QoL + low trust
- Utopia: high QoL + high trust + aligned AI + moderate control

---

### 6. `calculations.ts` - Core Utilities & Re-exports
**Purpose:** Backward compatibility + core utils that don't fit elsewhere

**Functions:**
- **Re-exports:** All functions from specialized modules
- `calculateUnemployment()` - AI-driven unemployment
- `calculateUnemploymentStabilityImpact()` - Stage-dependent effects
- `calculateTrustChange()` - Trust dynamics
- `calculateSocialStability()` - Social stability calculation
- `detectCrisis()` - Crisis detection

**Key Concepts:**
- 100% backward compatible (all old imports still work)
- Central hub for all calculation functions
- Unemployment starts at AI capability ~0.8, caps at 95%
- Trust has diminishing returns when increasing, accelerating loss when high
- Crisis detection triggers at unemployment > 25% (Stage 1â†’2)

## ðŸ“ˆ Benefits Achieved

### 1. Maintainability
- âœ… Easy to find code (logical grouping by purpose)
- âœ… Focused modules (each ~200-300 lines)
- âœ… Clear single responsibility for each module
- âœ… Easier to review and understand

### 2. Testability
- âœ… Can test each system independently
- âœ… Clear dependencies between modules
- âœ… Easier to mock for unit tests
- âœ… Focused test suites per module

### 3. Extensibility

- âœ… Easy to add new QoL dimensions to `qualityOfLife.ts`
- âœ… Easy to add new balance mechanics to `balance.ts`
- âœ… Prepared for Phase 2.5 research system

### 4. Collaboration
- âœ… Multiple developers can work on different modules
- âœ… Reduced merge conflicts (changes isolated)
- âœ… Clear module ownership
- âœ… Better code reviews (focused diffs)

### 5. Performance
- âœ… Tree-shaking friendly (can import just what you need)
- âœ… Better code splitting potential
- âœ… Clearer dependency graph
- âœ… No performance regression (all pure functions)

## ðŸ”„ Backward Compatibility

**100% backward compatible!** All existing code continues to work:

```typescript
// Old imports still work (via re-exports)
import { 
  calculateQualityOfLife,
  calculateAICapabilityGrowthRate,
  determineActualOutcome
} from '@/simulation/calculations';

// New imports (direct, tree-shake friendly)
import { calculateQualityOfLife } from '@/simulation/qualityOfLife';
import { calculateAICapabilityGrowthRate } from '@/simulation/balance';
import { determineActualOutcome } from '@/simulation/outcomes';
```

**No breaking changes!** All functions maintain exact same signatures.

---

## ðŸ“š Import Guide

### When to Import Directly
```typescript
// Building new features - import from specific modules
import { initializeCapabilityProfile } from '@/simulation/capabilities';
import { updateQualityOfLifeSystems } from '@/simulation/qualityOfLife';
import { calculateComputeGovernanceEffect } from '@/simulation/balance';
```

### When to Import from calculations.ts
```typescript
// Backward compatibility / existing code
import { calculateUnemployment, calculateTrustChange } from '@/simulation/calculations';

// Using multiple functions from different modules
import { 
  calculateQualityOfLife,    // from qualityOfLife.ts
  calculateAICapabilityGrowthRate,  // from balance.ts
  determineActualOutcome     // from outcomes.ts
} from '@/simulation/calculations';
```
