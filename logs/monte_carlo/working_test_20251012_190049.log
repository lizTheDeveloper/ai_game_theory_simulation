💡 SUMMARY & INSIGHTS
================================================================================

  KEY FINDINGS:

  🟡 MIXED OUTCOMES
     - Balance between positive and negative scenarios
     - High variance in outcome paths
     - Initial conditions and random events matter

  ⚠️  SLEEPER DETECTION IS POOR
     - Avg 0.7 undetected sleepers per run
     - 0.0% detection rate
     - Adversarial evaluation is hard (as expected)

  🚨 SANDBAGGING RARELY DETECTED
     - Only 0 detections across 3 runs
     - AIs successfully hide capabilities
     - Red teaming investment needs to be higher

  📉 EVALUATION INVESTMENT IS LOW
     - Avg quality: 3.8/10
     - Government not prioritizing evaluation
     - This enables sleeper agents to succeed
