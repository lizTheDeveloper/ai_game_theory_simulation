🎲 MONTE CARLO SIMULATION - FULL SYSTEM TEST
================================================================================

⚙️  CONFIGURATION:
  Runs: 2
  Duration: 60 months (5.0 years)
  Seed Range: 42000 - 42001


⏩ RUNNING 2 SIMULATIONS...


🏁 AI RACE INTENSITY: 23%
   Capability Gap: US 1.00 vs China 0.85 (gap: 0.15)
   Gap Contribution: 8%
   Tension Contribution: 15%
   Military Contribution: 0%
🚨 PHOSPHORUS SUPPLY SHOCK (production_failure)
   Price: 2.7x baseline
   Duration: 6 months
   Geopolitical tension: 45%

🌪️ ========== TIPPING POINT CASCADE BEGINNING ==========
Month: 0
Boundaries breached: 7/9
Tipping point risk: 98.0%

⚠️ CASCADING FEEDBACK LOOPS INITIATED
Climate → Biosphere → Freshwater → Ocean → Land
Mortality now scales with environmental thresholds (food, water, climate)
Recovery possible with aggressive environmental interventions
