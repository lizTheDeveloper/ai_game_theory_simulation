     - Initial conditions and random events matter

  ⚠️  SLEEPER DETECTION IS POOR
     - Avg 2.0 undetected sleepers per run
     - 0.0% detection rate
     - Adversarial evaluation is hard (as expected)

  🚨 SANDBAGGING RARELY DETECTED
     - Only 0 detections across 1 runs
     - AIs successfully hide capabilities
     - Red teaming investment needs to be higher
