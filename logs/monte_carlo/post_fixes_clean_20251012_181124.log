    OVERALL QOL: 1.030

  ⚠️  WARNING: High Basic Needs QoL (1.71) despite 94% mortality
      This suggests QoL calculation may not fully reflect human suffering.

    Water Insecurity (<0.4): 0 runs (0.0%)
    Thermal Uninhabitability (<0.5): 0 runs (0.0%)
    Shelter Insecurity (<0.4): 0 runs (0.0%)

  ⚠️  HIDDEN SUFFERING DETECTED: 6 runs with QoL >0.5 but survival failures
      This indicates aggregate QoL masks starvation/deaths in specific regions.

💡 SUMMARY & INSIGHTS
================================================================================

  KEY FINDINGS:

  🔴 HIGH EXTINCTION RATE (100.0%)
     - AI alignment is a critical challenge
     - Sleepers and catastrophic actions are effective
     - Government often fails to maintain control

  ⚠️  SLEEPER DETECTION IS POOR
     - Avg 1.8 undetected sleepers per run
     - 14.3% detection rate
     - Adversarial evaluation is hard (as expected)

  🚨 SANDBAGGING RARELY DETECTED
     - Only 0 detections across 10 runs
     - AIs successfully hide capabilities
     - Red teaming investment needs to be higher

  📉 EVALUATION INVESTMENT IS LOW
     - Avg quality: 4.5/10
     - Government not prioritizing evaluation
     - This enables sleeper agents to succeed
