📊 POPULATION STATUS DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================

  FINAL POPULATION STATUS:
    Thriving (>7B):       0 / 100 (0.0%)
    Stable (5-7B):        0 / 100 (0.0%)
    Declining (2-5B):     0 / 100 (0.0%)
    Critical (100M-2B):  93 / 100 (93.0%)
    Bottleneck (<100M):   7 / 100 (7.0%)
    Extinction (<10K):    0 / 100 (0.0%)

👥 POPULATION METRICS
================================================================================

  POPULATION AVERAGES:
    Initial: 8.00B
    Peak: 8.00B
    Final: 0.58B
    Decline: 92.8% from peak

  CRISIS THRESHOLDS HIT:
    Bottleneck (<100M): 7 runs (7.0%)
    Critical (<2B): 100 runs (100.0%)
    Extinction (<10K): 0 runs (0.0%)

  GROWTH DYNAMICS:
    Avg Birth Rate: 0.29% per year
    Avg Death Rate: 6.24% per year
    Avg Net Growth: -5.95% per year

  CARRYING CAPACITY:
    Avg Capacity: 1.00B
    Avg Pressure: 0.58 (pop/capacity ratio)
    Overshoot Runs: 0 (0.0%)

================================================================================
🚨 REFUGEE CRISIS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

  REFUGEE CRISIS FREQUENCY:
    Runs with Crises: 100 / 100 (100.0%)
    Avg Crises per Run: 109.0
    Avg Total Displaced: 0M people

  CRISIS CAUSES:
    ecosystem: 100 occurrences (100.0% of runs)
    nuclear: 61 occurrences (61.0% of runs)

  REFUGEE IMPACTS:
    Avg Max Social Tension: 0.0%
    Avg Max Economic Strain: 0.0%
    High Tension Runs (>70%): 0 (0.0%)

================================================================================
💀 EXTINCTION VS CRASH DISTINCTION
================================================================================

  OUTCOME CLASSIFICATION:
    Population Crashes (>20% decline, survived): 100 (100.0%)
    Near-Extinction (bottleneck): 7 (7.0%)
    True Extinction (<10K): 0 (0.0%)

  KEY INSIGHT:
    ✓ System successfully distinguishes crashes from extinction!
      100 runs had crashes but humanity survived.

================================================================================
🎯 OUTCOME CORRELATIONS
================================================================================

  OUTCOME DISTRIBUTION:
    extinction: 100 (100.0%)

  POPULATION STATUS → OUTCOME:
    critical (93 runs):
      Utopia: 0%
      Dystopia: 0%
      Extinction: 100%
    bottleneck (7 runs):
      Utopia: 0%
      Dystopia: 0%
      Extinction: 100%

  HIGH REFUGEE CRISES (≥3) → OUTCOME:
    Total Runs: 100
    Utopia: 0%
    Dystopia: 0% ⚠️  Fortress world risk
    Extinction: 100%

================================================================================
💡 SUMMARY
================================================================================

  POPULATION SYSTEM VALIDATION:
    ⚠️  Significant population decline observed (0.58B average)

  REFUGEE SYSTEM VALIDATION:
    ✓ Refugee crises are common (100% of runs)
      Triggers: climate, war, famine working as designed

  KEY FEATURES WORKING:
    ✓ Concrete population tracking (8.0B → varying outcomes)
    ✓ Crash vs extinction distinction
    ✓ Carrying capacity mechanics
    ✓ Refugee crisis triggers
