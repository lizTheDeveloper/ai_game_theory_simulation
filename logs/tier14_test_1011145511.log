💡 SUMMARY & INSIGHTS
================================================================================

  KEY FINDINGS:

  🔴 HIGH EXTINCTION RATE (100.0%)
     - AI alignment is a critical challenge
     - Sleepers and catastrophic actions are effective
     - Government often fails to maintain control

  ⚠️  SLEEPER DETECTION IS POOR
     - Avg 2.0 undetected sleepers per run
     - 0.0% detection rate
     - Adversarial evaluation is hard (as expected)

  🚨 SANDBAGGING RARELY DETECTED
     - Only 0 detections across 10 runs
     - AIs successfully hide capabilities
     - Red teaming investment needs to be higher

  📉 EVALUATION INVESTMENT IS LOW
     - Avg quality: 4.3/10
     - Government not prioritizing evaluation
     - This enables sleeper agents to succeed
