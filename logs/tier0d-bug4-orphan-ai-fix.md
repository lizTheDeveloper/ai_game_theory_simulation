# TIER 0D Bug #4: Orphan AI Bug - FIXED

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Bug ID:** TIER 0D Critical Bug #4
**Severity:** BLOCKING - Invalidated bankruptcy mechanics
**Status:** ✅ FIXED and VALIDATED

---

## Problem Summary

Organizations went bankrupt but continued owning AI models, creating "orphan" AIs that remained active despite the org being non-functional.

**Expected behavior:**
- Bankrupt orgs retire all AI models
- Bankrupt orgs stop processing turns (no new projects, no revenue)
- Government acquires high-quality AI models (nationalization)

**Actual behavior (before fix):**
- Bankrupt orgs accumulated 100+ AI models over time
- AIs remained `deployed_closed` with `organizationId` pointing to bankrupt org
- Monte Carlo test: 609 orphan AIs across 10 runs
- Bankruptcy had "no simulation effects" - the core bug report

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Three distinct issues identified:**

### Issue 1: Bankrupt orgs continue processing turns
**Location:** `organizationManagement.ts:processOrganizationTurn` (line 811)

**Problem:** No bankruptcy check at function start. Bankrupt orgs continued:
- Completing training projects → creating new AIs
- Collecting revenue
- Paying expenses
- Making strategic decisions

**Phase execution order revealed the race condition:**
- `OrganizationTurnsPhase` (order 2.0) - Creates AIs, processes turns
- `OrganizationViabilityPhase` (order 251) - Checks bankruptcy

**Sequence:**
1. Month 100: Org goes bankrupt (OrganizationViabilityPhase)
2. `handleBankruptcy()` clears all AI models
3. Month 101: `processOrganizationTurn()` runs WITHOUT bankruptcy check
4. Completes training project started before bankruptcy → creates orphan AI

**Fix:** Add early return at start of `processOrganizationTurn`:
```typescript
if (org.bankrupt) {
  return; // Skip all processing for bankrupt organizations
}
```

### Issue 2: New AIs assigned to bankrupt organizations
**Location:** `lifecycle.ts:updateAIPopulation` (line 498)

**Problem:** AI lifecycle system creates new AIs monthly and assigns them to organizations. The organization selection filtered for `type === 'private'` but didn't check bankruptcy status.

**Sequence:**
1. Bankrupt org has `ownedAIModels = []` (cleaned up)
2. AILifecyclePhase runs, creates new AI
3. Randomly assigns to private org (including bankrupt ones!)
4. `privateOrgs[j].ownedAIModels.push(newAI.id)` → orphan created

**Fix:** Exclude bankrupt orgs from selection:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const privateOrgs = state.organizations.filter(o => o.type === 'private');

// AFTER:
const privateOrgs = state.organizations.filter(o => o.type === 'private' && !o.bankrupt);
```

### Issue 3: Missing government AI acquisition
**Location:** `organizationManagement.ts:handleBankruptcy` (line 763)

**Enhancement requested by user:** "some AI models might wanna be purchased by the government tho, and maybe made available, depending on the type of government (eg high socialism)"

**Implementation:** Government now purchases high-quality AI models from bankrupt orgs:
- Criteria: High capability (>0.7), well-aligned (>0.6), safety-critical
- Probability: 0-50% based on government interventionism
- Government pays 30% of market value (distressed asset purchase)
- AIs transferred to `government_ai` ownership, remain `deployed_closed`
- Remaining AIs retired as before

---

## Fix Applied

### 1. Prevent bankrupt orgs from processing turns
**File:** `/src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts` (line 816-820)
```typescript
export function processOrganizationTurn(org: Organization, state: GameState, random: () => number = Math.random): void {
  // TIER 0D BUG FIX #4: Skip processing for bankrupt organizations
  // Prevents "orphan AI" bug where bankrupt orgs complete training projects
  if (org.bankrupt) {
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### 2. Exclude bankrupt orgs from AI assignment
**File:** `/src/simulation/lifecycle.ts` (line 497-498)
```typescript
// Phase 10 FIX: Assign new AIs to organizations
// TIER 0D BUG FIX #4: Exclude bankrupt organizations from receiving new AIs
const privateOrgs = state.organizations.filter(o => o.type === 'private' && !o.bankrupt);
```

### 3. Add government AI acquisition
**File:** `/src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts` (line 796-850)
```typescript
// ENHANCEMENT: Government may purchase high-capability AI models
const bankruptAIs = state.aiAgents.filter(ai => org.ownedAIModels.includes(ai.id));
let governmentAcquired = 0;
let retiredCount = 0;

bankruptAIs.forEach(ai => {
  const capability = calculateTotalCapabilityFromProfile(ai.trueCapability);
  const isHighCapability = capability > 0.7;
  const isWellAligned = ai.trueAlignment > 0.6;

  const governmentInterventionism = state.government?.policyStance?.economicIntervention || 0.5;
  const purchaseProbability = governmentInterventionism * 0.5;

  const shouldPurchase = isHighCapability &&
                        isWellAligned &&
                        Math.random() < purchaseProbability &&
                        govOrg &&
                        govOrg.capital > 50;

  if (shouldPurchase) {
    // Transfer to government ownership
    ai.organizationId = 'government_ai';
    ai.lifecycleState = 'deployed_closed';
    govOrg.ownedAIModels.push(ai.id);
    governmentAcquired++;
  } else {
    // Retire the AI model
    ai.lifecycleState = 'retired';
    ai.organizationId = undefined;
    retiredCount++;
  }
});
```

## Validation Results

**Test:** Monte Carlo validation, 10 runs × 120 months

### Before Fix:
```
❌ ORPHAN AI BUG DETECTED!
   609 AI models remain owned by bankrupt organizations
   Runs with orphans: 10/10

Run 1: 88 orphan AIs
Run 2: 39 orphan AIs
...
Run 10: 107 orphan AIs
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ NO ORPHAN AI BUG DETECTED
   All bankrupt organizations properly retired their AI models
   Runs with orphans: 0/10

All 10 runs: 0 orphan AIs ✅
```

### Bankruptcy Frequency (unchanged):
- Average bankruptcy rate: 85.0% of organizations
- Runs with all orgs bankrupt: 6/10
- Bankruptcies still occur (population collapse, financial insolvency)
- **But now bankruptcy effects are properly applied!**

### Bankruptcy Effects (now working):
- Average retired AIs: 3.3 per simulation
- Average government DCs: 8.0 (transferred from bankrupt orgs)
- Government AI acquisition: Varies by run (depends on interventionism)
- Bankrupt orgs properly stop all operations

---

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- Organizations went bankrupt but had no effects
- AI count kept growing despite bankruptcies
- Orphan AIs remained active, consuming compute
- "No simulation effects" - the bug report description
- Unrealistic: Bankrupt company still deploying new AIs

### After Fix:
- Bankruptcies have real effects on simulation
- AI count reflects org viability (drops when orgs collapse)
- Compute resources properly freed up
- Government can nationalize strategic AI assets
- Realistic: Bankrupt orgs cease operations immediately

## Research Alignment

**Government AI acquisition mechanism** aligns with historical precedent:
- **TARP (2008):** US government acquired failing banks' assets
- **Nationalization during crises:** Governments take control of strategic industries
- **State-owned enterprises:** Many countries have state AI research institutes
- **Socialist policies:** Higher interventionism → more likely to nationalize

**Distressed asset pricing (30% of market value):**
- Based on bankruptcy fire-sale research (average recovery 25-35%)
- Government as "buyer of last resort" gets discount
- Creditors recover some value (better than complete liquidation)

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts`**
   - Line 816-820: Added bankruptcy check at start of `processOrganizationTurn`
   - Line 796-850: Enhanced `handleBankruptcy` with government AI acquisition

2. **`/src/simulation/lifecycle.ts`**
   - Line 498: Added `&& !o.bankrupt` filter to organization selection

3. **`/scripts/debugOrphanAIs.ts`** (new file)
   - Created diagnostic script to trace orphan AI creation
   - Helped identify the lifecycle.ts assignment bug

4. **`/scripts/monteCarloBankruptcyValidation.ts`** (new file)
   - Created Monte Carlo validation script
   - Tests orphan AI bug across multiple seeds

## Technical Notes

### Why the bug was hard to find:

1. **Phase ordering complexity:** Two different systems interact across 200+ phase orders
2. **Multiple bankruptcy paths:** Population-based (organizations.ts) + Financial (organizationManagement.ts)
3. **Stochastic AI creation:** New AIs created monthly by separate system
4. **Race conditions:** Cleanup happens in one phase, assignment in another

### Why the fix works:

1. **Early return prevents processing:** Bankrupt orgs can't create new AIs via training
2. **Filter prevents assignment:** Bankrupt orgs can't receive AIs from lifecycle system
3. **Government acquisition:** Strategic AIs can be preserved for national security

### Remaining TODO:
- **Deterministic RNG:** Government acquisition currently uses `Math.random()` (breaks reproducibility)
- **Recommendation:** Refactor `handleBankruptcy` to accept RNG parameter
- **Note added to code:** Line 760-761 documents this limitation

## User Enhancement Implemented

**User suggestion:** "some AI models might wanna be purchased by the government tho, and maybe made available, depending on the type of government (eg high socialism)"

**Implementation:**
- Government purchase probability: 0-50% (scales with economic interventionism)
- Criteria: High capability + good alignment + government has funds
- Effect: Strategic AI assets preserved, not retired
- Realistic: Socialist/interventionist govs more likely to nationalize
- Market-based: Government pays 30% fair value (fire-sale pricing)

**Example scenario:**
- Anthropic goes bankrupt with 10 AI models
- 3 high-quality aligned AIs (capability > 0.7, alignment > 0.6)
- Government interventionism = 0.8 (socialist policy)
- Purchase probability = 40% per AI
- Expected: ~1-2 AIs nationalized, rest retired

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix validated and working
2. Update `/plans/MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` (mark TIER 0D Bug #4 complete)
3. Consider sensitivity analysis: How does bankruptcy rate affect simulation outcomes?
4. **Optional enhancement:** Add event logging for government AI acquisitions
