# Project Specification
## AI Alignment Game Theory Simulation

**Created:** December 6, 2025 (Migrated from MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
**Purpose:** Central hub defining project-wide requirements and standards

---

## Purpose

Model pathways from AI super-alignment to sustainable human flourishing through research-backed simulation. The system explores: **What happens after we solve AI alignment?**

**Philosophy:** Research-backed realism over balance tuning. Every mechanic grounded in peer-reviewed research (2024-2025 preferred). This is a research tool, not a game.

---

## Requirements

### Requirement: Research-Backed Realism
The project SHALL ground all mechanics in peer-reviewed sources.

#### Scenario: Parameter Justification
- WHEN implementing a new mechanic
- THEN it MUST have 2+ peer-reviewed sources (2024-2025 preferred)
- AND parameter values MUST be justified from research data
- AND mechanism description MUST explain interactions with existing systems
- AND expected timeline MUST be defined (early/mid/late game relevance)
- AND failure modes MUST be documented

#### Scenario: Monte Carlo Validation
- WHEN a mechanic is implemented
- THEN it MUST be validated with N≥10 Monte Carlo runs
- AND outcome distributions MUST be checked for realism
- AND runs MUST be deterministic (same seed = same results)

### Requirement: Hierarchical Roadmap Organization
The project SHALL maintain domain-specific roadmaps for simulation and frontend work.

#### Scenario: Feature Routing
- WHEN a new feature is proposed
- THEN it MUST be assigned to simulation OR frontend domain
- AND cross-domain features MUST specify deltas for both domains
- AND features MUST link to parent roadmap

### Requirement: Priority-Based Execution
The project SHALL prioritize work using four-tier system.

**Priority Tiers:**
- **CRITICAL:** Blockers, must fix immediately (block all other work)
- **HIGH:** Important, next sprint (1-2 weeks)
- **MEDIUM:** Planned, 1-2 months
- **LOW:** Backlog, 3+ months

#### Scenario: Token Conservation Mode
- WHEN in token conservation mode
- THEN only CRITICAL and HIGH priority work SHALL be executed
- AND MEDIUM/LOW work SHALL be deferred
- AND agents SHALL use extreme efficiency (grep first, skip docs, exit early)

### Requirement: Quality Gates
The project SHALL enforce two mandatory quality gates for all features.

**Quality Gate 1: Research Validation**
- Super-alignment-researcher + research-skeptic review
- Must achieve Grade B or higher
- Grade D/F blocks implementation

**Quality Gate 2: Architecture Review**
- Architecture-skeptic post-implementation review
- CRITICAL/HIGH issues MUST be addressed before merge
- Grade C or lower blocks merge

#### Scenario: Feature Implementation Workflow
- WHEN implementing a complex feature
- THEN orchestrator agent SHALL coordinate workflow
- AND research validation MUST pass (Quality Gate 1)
- AND implementation MUST follow established patterns
- AND architecture review MUST pass (Quality Gate 2)
- AND Monte Carlo validation MUST show N≥10 deterministic runs

### Requirement: Deterministic Simulation
The project SHALL maintain reproducibility through deterministic RNG.

#### Scenario: Monte Carlo Reproducibility
- WHEN running N≥10 simulations with the same seed
- THEN all runs MUST produce identical outputs
- AND coefficient of variation MUST be < 0.01%
- AND `Math.random()` MUST NOT be used (use RNG function)

### Requirement: Defensive Programming
The project SHALL fail loudly on invalid values (no silent fallbacks).

#### Scenario: NaN Detection
- WHEN a calculation produces a numeric value
- THEN it MUST be validated with assertion utilities
- AND fallback values SHALL NOT be used in simulation calculations
- AND initialization/UI display MAY use fallbacks (with explicit justification)

#### Scenario: Missing Required Values
- WHEN a required parameter is missing
- THEN the system MUST throw a clear error
- AND workflows MUST fail (not continue with defaults)
- AND silent fallbacks (like `|| 0`, `?? defaultValue`) MUST NOT be used

### Requirement: Multi-Agent Coordination
The project SHALL route complex work to specialized agents.

**Primary Agents:**
- **orchestrator** - Complex features, multi-system changes
- **simulation-maintainer** - Simulation code (src/simulation/, phases)
- **far-future-ux-designer** - Frontend/dashboard work
- **super-alignment-researcher** - Research literature, parameter extraction
- **research-skeptic** - Validation, contradictory evidence
- **architecture-skeptic** - Post-implementation review
- **priya** - Monte Carlo validation, statistical analysis
- **architect** - Roadmap maintenance, plan archival (end of sessions)
- **devops** - Infrastructure, CI/CD, multi-worker setup

#### Scenario: Feature Implementation
- WHEN a complex feature is requested
- THEN the main context SHALL route to orchestrator agent
- AND orchestrator SHALL spawn specialists as needed
- AND architect SHALL be invoked at end of session for roadmap cleanup

### Requirement: Historical Preservation
The project SHALL preserve implementation histories and research context.

#### Scenario: Feature Completion
- WHEN a feature is completed
- THEN detailed implementation notes MUST be archived
- AND research findings MUST be preserved
- AND validation reports MUST be linked
- AND git history MUST be maintained

## Development Standards

### Phase-Based Architecture
~37 composable phases per simulation step. See [Simulation Spec](../simulation/spec.md).

### Emoji Conventions
ONE canonical emoji per concept. All emojis MUST be registered in `docs/EMOJI_EVENT_MAP.txt`.
- ✅ Success
- ❌ Error (all errors use this, not 💀🔥)
- ⚠️ Warning
- 🚨 Critical alert
- 🌍 Planetary/environment
- 🤖 AI systems
- ☢️ Nuclear
- 🔬 Research/science

See: `docs/EMOJI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (one-page cheat sheet)

### Logging
- Always save logs to `/logs/` (NEVER `/tmp/`, which gets cleared)
- Use structured format with emoji prefixes
- Include phase names and relevant context

### Git Workflow
- Never run force push to main/master
- Always verify authorship before `git commit --amend`
- Never skip hooks unless explicitly requested
- Create commits only when user explicitly asks
