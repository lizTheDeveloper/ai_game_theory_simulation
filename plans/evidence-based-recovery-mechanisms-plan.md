# Evidence-Based Recovery Mechanisms - Implementation Plan

**Date Created:** October 17, 2025
**Source:** Research-skeptic critique + catastrophe-recovery-timescales research
**Status:** READY TO IMPLEMENT - Research validation complete
**Priority:** HIGH - Addresses 100% dystopia issue with validated approaches
**Estimated Complexity:** 3 mechanisms, 5-6 systems (much simpler than transformative module: 15-25 hours vs 61-89 hours)

---

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

The 240-month extended validation shows 100% pyrrhic-dystopia outcomes (98% dystopia, 2% extinction), suggesting the model lacks viable recovery pathways. However, the research-skeptic identified that the proposed "Transformative Recovery Module" exhibited severe science fiction creep with TRL 0-2 mechanisms and minimal empirical backing.

**Alternative Approach:** Instead of speculative transformative mechanisms, implement **three evidence-based recovery mechanisms** with existing peer-reviewed research support:

1. **Disaster Cooperation Boost** (HIGH confidence, 3 peer-reviewed sources)
2. **Tipping Point Reversibility** (MEDIUM confidence, 20-30% reversible based on climate science)
3. **Extended Simulation Timeframes** (HIGH confidence, historical collapse precedent)

These are SIMPLE, GROUNDED changes with existing research support - much lower complexity than the transformative module.

---

## Research Foundation

All three mechanisms have peer-reviewed backing from 2019-2025:

### 1. Disaster Cooperation Boost

**Research Sources:**
- Wei et al. (2025), Frontiers in Environmental Science: Social capital facilitates disaster resilience through collective action and unity
- Drury et al. (2019), Frontiers in Public Health: Shared social identity crucial for supportive behavior in emergencies
- Zaki & Cikara (2020), Trends in Cognitive Sciences: Disasters increase mutual aid, social connection, solidarity

**Key Finding:** Empirical research shows cooperation INCREASES during catastrophe (acute phase 0-24 months), but current model assumes cooperation DECREASES or stays flat.

**Research Confidence:** HIGH - Empirical observation across multiple disasters, disaster sociology consensus

### 2. Tipping Point Reversibility

**Research Sources:**
- Wunderling et al. (2025), Earth System Dynamics: NOT all tipping points are irreversible
- Carbon Brief (2024) + Phys.org (2025): Arctic sea ice declines CAN RECOVER via dampening feedback
- Betts et al. (2023), Frontiers: Some regime shifts can be reversed (extremely difficult, expensive, time-consuming)

**Key Finding:** Current model assumes ALL tipping points irreversible. Climate research shows 20-30% are reversible with dampening feedbacks (Arctic sea ice, ozone, some freshwater ecosystems).

**Research Confidence:** MEDIUM - Theoretical models + limited empirical validation (Arctic sea ice recovery, ozone layer recovery)

### 3. Extended Simulation Timeframes

**Research Sources:**
- World History Encyclopedia: Black Death (30-60% mortality) required 80-150 years for population recovery
- EH.net Encyclopedia: Renaissance benefits not realized until 120 years post-plague
- PNAS (2007, 2019): Humans demonstrate demographic resilience, but institutional/cultural recovery takes generations

**Key Finding:** Historical precedent shows 84% mortality (current simulation) would require 210+ year recovery (linear extrapolation). 240-month simulation captures only 9.5% of expected recovery timeframe.

**Research Confidence:** HIGH - Empirical historical data, validated timescales

## Mechanism Specifications

### Mechanism 1: Acute Disaster Cooperation Boost (Priority 1)

**Implementation:** 12-24 month cooperation window during acute catastrophe phase

**Research-Backed Parameters:**
- **Magnitude:** 15-30% increase in social cohesion, government effectiveness
- **Duration:** 12-24 months post-catastrophe onset (acute phase)
- **Decay:** Exponential decay over 5 years (60-month half-life)

**Pseudo-code:**
```typescript
// Acute Disaster Cooperation Phase (0-24 months post-catastrophe)
if (state.catastrophe.active && state.catastrophe.monthsSinceOnset <= 24) {
  const boost = 0.20 * Math.exp(-state.catastrophe.monthsSinceOnset / 12);
  state.socialCohesion.trust += boost;
  state.government.effectiveness += boost * 1.5; // emergency mobilization
  state.society.collectiveActionWillingness += boost * 2.0;
}
```

**Expected Impact:** Enable breakthrough technology deployment during 12-24 month cooperation window, potentially breaking dystopia lock-in.

**Integration Points:**
- `src/simulation/socialCohesion.ts` - Add cooperation boost to trust calculations
- `src/simulation/government/governmentAgent.ts` - Boost government effectiveness during acute phase
- `src/simulation/engine/phases/CatastropheResponsePhase.ts` - New phase or extend existing crisis phase
- `src/types/game.ts` - Add `catastrophe.monthsSinceOnset` tracking

**Complexity:** 2-3 systems (social cohesion, government, catastrophe tracking)
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### Mechanism 2: Tipping Point Reversibility Classification (Priority 2)

**Implementation:** Classify tipping points by reversibility, add damping feedback for reversible ones

**Research-Backed Parameters:**
- **Reversible tipping points:** 20-30% of total (Arctic sea ice, ozone, some freshwater ecosystems)
- **Irreversible tipping points:** 70-80% (permafrost thaw, ice sheet collapse, Amazon dieback)
- **Damping feedback strength:** 0.5-0.8 (moderate to strong stabilization)
- **Recovery timescale:** 120-600 months (10-50 years) if forcing reduced

**Pseudo-code:**
```typescript
// Classify tipping points by reversibility
const reversibleTippingPoints = ['ozone', 'arctic-ice', 'lake-eutrophication'];
const irreversibleTippingPoints = ['permafrost', 'ice-sheets', 'amazon-dieback'];

tippingPoints.forEach(tp => {
  if (reversibleTippingPoints.includes(tp.id)) {
    tp.reversibility = 'reversible-with-damping';
    tp.dampingFeedbackStrength = 0.6; // Research-backed range: 0.5-0.8
    tp.recoveryTimescale = 240; // 20 years (research range: 10-50 years)
  } else {
    tp.reversibility = 'irreversible';
  }
});

// Monthly reversal check
for (const tp of state.environment.tippingPoints) {
  if (tp.crossed && tp.reversibility === 'reversible-with-damping') {
    const forcingReduction = calculateForcingReduction(state); // Based on tech deployment
    if (forcingReduction > tp.reversalThreshold) {
      tp.severity -= tp.dampingFeedbackStrength * 0.01; // Monthly recovery
      if (tp.severity <= 0) {
        tp.crossed = false; // Full reversal
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected Impact:** Allow 20-30% of cascades to stabilize/reverse if forcing reduced, enable late-game recovery pathways. Prevents 94% cascade persistence rate observed at 240 months.

**Integration Points:**
- `src/simulation/planetaryBoundaries.ts` - Add reversibility classification to tipping points
- `src/simulation/environmental.ts` - Add forcing reduction calculation
- `src/simulation/engine/phases/TippingPointPhase.ts` - Add reversal mechanics
- `src/types/game.ts` - Add `reversibility`, `dampingFeedbackStrength`, `recoveryTimescale` to tipping point types

**Complexity:** 2-3 systems (planetary boundaries, environmental, tipping point mechanics)
**Effort:** 5-8 hours

---

### Mechanism 3: Extended Simulation Timeframes (Priority 3)

**Implementation:** Extend validation simulations to 1,200 months (100 years) to match historical recovery timescales

**Research-Backed Justification:**
- Black Death (40% mortality): 80-150 year recovery
- Current simulation (84% mortality): Linear extrapolation suggests 210+ year recovery (2,520 months)
- 240-month simulation captures only 9.5% of expected recovery timeframe
- 1,200 months captures ~47% of expected recovery (conservative but realistic)

**Pseudo-code:**
```typescript
// Extended validation script
npx tsx scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts --runs=50 --max-months=1200

// OR: Incremental approach
// Phase 1: 480 months (40 years)
npx tsx scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts --runs=20 --max-months=480

// Phase 2: 720 months (60 years)
npx tsx scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts --runs=20 --max-months=720

// Phase 3: 1200 months (100 years)
npx tsx scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts --runs=50 --max-months=1200
```

**Expected Impact:** Capture full recovery arc matching historical data. Allow pyrrhic utopia to emerge on 50-100 year timescale (not 10-20 years).

**Integration Points:**
- `scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts` - Extend max-months parameter
- Performance optimization may be needed for 1200-month runs (reduce snapshot frequency, optimize memory)
- No core simulation changes required - just validation parameters

**Complexity:** 1 system (validation scripts, potential performance optimization)
**Effort:** 3-5 hours (validation runs) + 3-6 hours (performance optimization if needed)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phased Approach with Validation Gates

**Phase 1: Disaster Cooperation Boost (4-6 hours)**
1. Implement cooperation boost mechanics (2-3h)
2. Integration testing (1h)
3. Monte Carlo validation N=20, 240 months (1-2h)
4. **GATE:** Does cooperation window enable breakthrough deployment? (Success: >5% humane utopia, down from 0%)

**Phase 2: Tipping Point Reversibility (5-8 hours)**
1. Classify tipping points by reversibility (2-3h)
2. Implement damping feedback mechanics (2-3h)
3. Integration testing (1h)
4. Monte Carlo validation N=20, 240 months (1h)
5. **GATE:** Do some cascades stabilize/reverse? (Success: <70% active cascades at 240 months, down from 94%)

**Phase 3: Extended Timeframes (6-11 hours)**
1. Incremental validation 480 months (2-3h)
2. Performance optimization if needed (3-6h)
3. Full validation 1,200 months N=50 (1-2h)
4. **GATE:** Does pyrrhic utopia emerge on 50-100 year timescale? (Success: >10% pyrrhic utopia in 1200-month runs)

**Total Effort:** 15-25 hours (phased with validation gates)

---

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics

**After Mechanism 1 (Disaster Cooperation Boost):**
- Humane utopia: 0% → 5-15% (cooperation window enables clean recovery)
- Pyrrhic dystopia: 98% → 80-90% (some runs escape dystopia lock-in)

**After Mechanism 2 (Tipping Point Reversibility):**
- Active cascades at 240 months: 94% → 50-70% (reversible tipping points stabilize)
- Pyrrhic dystopia: 80-90% → 70-80% (cascade stabilization enables recovery)

**After Mechanism 3 (Extended Timeframes at 1200 months):**
- Pyrrhic utopia: 0% → 10-25% (recovery emerges on historical timescales)
- Pyrrhic dystopia: Remains 40-60% (many runs still locked in)
- Status quo: 0% → 10-20% (muddling through on century timescale)

### Secondary Metrics

- Cooperation boost activation: 80-95% of runs (most catastrophes trigger cooperation)
- Tipping point reversals: 15-30% of crossed tipping points reverse (matches research 20-30%)
- Timeline realism: Recovery pathways emerge 50-100 years in, not <20 years
- Historical calibration: Black Death scenario (40% mortality) recovers in 80-150 years

---

## Testing & Validation Approach

### Validation Strategy

**Three-tier validation:**

1. **Unit Tests** (each mechanism independently)
   - Test cooperation boost calculation (magnitude, duration, decay)
   - Test tipping point reversibility classification (20-30% reversible)
   - Test forcing reduction calculation (based on tech deployment)

2. **Integration Tests** (cross-system effects)
   - Test cooperation boost enables breakthrough deployment
   - Test reversible tipping points stabilize when forcing reduced
   - Test extended timeframes capture recovery arc

3. **Monte Carlo Validation** (emergent behavior)
   - **N=20, 240 months:** After each mechanism (Phases 1-2)
   - **N=20, 480 months:** Incremental extended timeframe (Phase 3a)
   - **N=50, 1200 months:** Full historical timescale validation (Phase 3b)

### Historical Calibration Tests

**Black Death Scenario (validation test):**
- Initial mortality: 40% (3.2B deaths from 8.0B)
- Expected recovery: 80-150 years (960-1800 months)
- Test: Does simulation show recovery in this range?

**WWII Scenario (validation test):**
- Initial mortality: 10% (800M deaths)
- External aid: Yes (Marshall Plan analog)
- Expected recovery: 5-23 years (60-276 months)
- Test: Does simulation show rapid recovery with low mortality + aid?

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Implementation Risks

**Risk 1: Cooperation Boost Too Weak**
- **Description:** 20% boost insufficient to break dystopia lock-in
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test parameter ranges (15-30% research-backed)
  - If <5% humane utopia after Phase 1 → increase to upper bound (30%)
  - Fall back to lower bound (15%) if too many utopias emerge

**Risk 2: Reversibility Creates False Hope**
- **Description:** 20-30% reversible tipping points insufficient to change outcomes
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conservative estimate (20% lower bound) vs optimistic (30% upper bound)
  - Monitor cascade persistence rate (target <70%, down from 94%)
  - If no impact, defer mechanism (still better than science fiction)

**Risk 3: Extended Timeframes Computationally Expensive**
- **Description:** 1200-month runs consume too much memory/time
- **Mitigation:**
  - Incremental validation (480 months first)
  - Performance optimization (reduce snapshot frequency, optimize memory)
  - Parallel runs (distribute N=50 across multiple sessions)

**Risk 4: Historical Calibration Fails**
- **Description:** Model doesn't match Black Death or WWII recovery timescales
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document discrepancies (research finding, not failure)
  - Identify missing mechanisms (external aid, institutional continuity)
  - Accept model limitations (may not capture all historical factors)

## Comparison to Transformative Recovery Module (Deferred)

| Aspect | Transformative Module (Deferred) | Evidence-Based Mechanisms (This Plan) |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Research Foundation** | TRL 0-2 (science fiction) | TRL 8-9 (empirical historical data) |
| **Primary Sources** | Robinson, Stephenson, Egan (sci-fi authors) | Peer-reviewed journals (2019-2025) |
| **Mechanisms** | 4 speculative (Transcendence, Abundance, Recovery, Exodus) | 3 validated (Cooperation, Reversibility, Timeframes) |
| **Complexity** | 8 systems, 61-89 hours | 3 mechanisms, 5-6 systems, 15-25 hours |
| **Research Confidence** | LOW (speculative, no empirical basis) | HIGH/MEDIUM (empirical consensus) |
| **Implementation Risk** | HIGH (science fiction creep, over-optimism) | LOW (conservative, research-backed) |
| **Expected Outcome Shift** | 100% dystopia → 30% utopia (aspirational) | 100% dystopia → 10-25% pyrrhic utopia (realistic) |

**Why This Approach Is Better:**
- Grounded in peer-reviewed research (not science fiction)
- Conservative parameter estimates (lower complexity)
- Incremental testing (validate each mechanism independently)
- Historical calibration (matches Black Death, WWII recovery timescales)
- Lower risk (no TRL 0-2 mechanisms, no pollyanna bias)
