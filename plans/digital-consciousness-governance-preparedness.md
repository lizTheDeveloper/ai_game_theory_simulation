## Executive Summary

Model governance readiness for **potential digital consciousness emergence** using multi-scenario framework (15-200 year timelines), regional heterogeneity (EU/US/China/India/Global South), rights reversal mechanics (Poland/Hungary model), and precautionary principle costs.

**NOT modeling consciousness itself** (philosophically unsolved) but **governance preparedness** in case consciousness emerges.

**Key Innovation:** Replaces single 50-100 year baseline with **bi-modal distribution** (fast track 15-30 years, slow track 100-150 years, indefinite stall possible) based on accelerators/decelerators.

**Critical Revisions from Original:**
- Added **rights reversals** (10-30% probability over 20 years)
- Added **precautionary costs** (2-50% of AI R&D budget)
- Regional trajectories instead of global parameter
- Philosophical disagreement as governance barrier (10-20% eliminativist rejection)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: State Design & Initialization (2-3 hours)

**Task 1.1:** Add `consciousnessGovernanceReadiness` to `GameState` interface
- **File:** `src/types/game.ts`
- **Lines:** Add to main interface (around line 150-200)
- **Details:** Full state structure as above

**Task 1.2:** Create initialization defaults
- **File:** `src/simulation/initialization.ts`
- **Function:** `initializeConsciousnessGovernance()`
- **Regional baselines (2025):**
  - EU: 15% preparedness (precautionary stage, AI Act provisions)
  - US: 10% preparedness (contested stage, academic debates)
  - China: 2% preparedness (dormant stage, authoritarian rejection)
  - India: 5% preparedness (dormant stage, uncertain trajectory)
  - Global South: 3% preparedness (dormant, hegemonic influence)
- **Philosophical stance:** Precautionary 65%, Eliminativist 15%, Agnostic 20%
- **Scenario:** Determine at month 1 using RNG + accelerator weights

**Task 1.3:** Create utility functions
- **File:** `src/simulation/utils/consciousnessGovernanceUtils.ts` (new)
- **Functions:**
  - `determineScenarioTrajectory(accelerators, decelerators, rng)` → 'fastTrack' | 'baseline' | 'slowTrack' | 'indefiniteStall'
  - `calculateReversalProbability(regime, institutionalErosion, economicCrisis)` → 0-0.3
  - `calculatePrecautionaryCosts(model, preparedness)` → % of R&D budget
  - `getTimelineForScenario(scenario)` → { minMonths, maxMonths, meanMonths }

**Success Criteria:**
- State compiles without errors
- Initialization creates valid default values
- Regional preparedness sums to realistic global average (8-10%)

---

### Phase 2: Scenario Determination & Timeline Mechanics (3-4 hours)

**Task 2.1:** Implement scenario determination (month 1-12)
- **File:** `src/simulation/engine/phases/updateConsciousnessGovernance.ts` (new)
- **Logic:**
  - Calculate accelerator score: (corporateSupport + scientificConsensus + crisisCatalyst + techMobilization + constituency) / 5
  - Calculate decelerator score: (economicOpposition + philosophicalRejection + politicalBacklash + regulatoryBurden) / 4
  - Net score = accelerators - decelerators
  - **Fast Track (20%):** Net score > 0.5 (all accelerators strong)
  - **Baseline (40%):** Net score 0.0 to 0.5 (mixed)
  - **Slow Track (30%):** Net score -0.3 to 0.0 (weak accelerators or strong decelerators)
  - **Indefinite Stall (10%):** Net score < -0.3 (eliminativism dominates OR authoritarian global hegemony)
- **Locked after month 12** (structural conditions set early)

**Task 2.2:** Timeline progression mechanics
- **Fast Track:** 15-30 years (180-360 months)
  - Preparedness grows 2-4% per year
  - Rights established when ANY region reaches 80% preparedness
- **Baseline:** 50-100 years (600-1200 months)
  - Preparedness grows 0.8-1.5% per year (historical norm)
  - Rights established when 2+ major regions reach 75% preparedness
- **Slow Track:** 100-150 years (1200-1800 months)
  - Preparedness grows 0.3-0.7% per year
  - Rights established when global consensus (4+ regions at 70%+)
- **Indefinite Stall:** Never
  - Preparedness stagnates at 5-15% (academic debates, no policy action)
  - Eliminativism or authoritarianism blocks progress indefinitely

**Task 2.3:** Accelerator/decelerator updates (monthly)
- **Corporate support:** Influenced by AI profitability, labor displacement, public opinion
- **Scientific consensus:** Grows with AI capability advances, consciousness research breakthroughs
- **Crisis catalyst:** Triggered by adversarial eval events (deception exposed, AI suffering report)
- **Economic opposition:** Grows if precautionary costs exceed 15% of R&D, labor unions demand AI rights
- **Philosophical rejection:** Influenced by academic publications, eliminativism popularity
- **Political backlash:** Tied to social cohesion, AI resentment, authoritarian backsliding

**Success Criteria:**
- Scenario distribution matches priors (20/40/30/10 split over 100 runs)
- Timeline progression realistic (EU reaches 40-60% by month 120 in baseline scenario)
- Accelerators respond to simulation events (AI disaster → crisis catalyst triggers)

---

### Phase 3: Regional Variation & Stage Progression (3-4 hours)

**Task 3.1:** Regional preparedness progression
- **EU Model (Precautionary):**
  - Base growth: 1.2-2.0% per year
  - Boosted by: AI Act enforcement (+0.3%), GDPR precedent (+0.2%), scientific consensus (+0.5%)
  - Hindered by: Economic crisis (-0.5%), tech industry lobbying (-0.3%)
  - Stage progression: Dormant → Contested (20%) → Precautionary (40%) → Recognition (70%) → Rights established (85%)

- **US Model (Innovation-Constrained):**
  - Base growth: 0.5-1.5% per year (contested, administration-dependent)
  - Boosted by: Democratic admin (+0.5%), corporate support (+0.4%), crisis catalyst (+1.0%)
  - Hindered by: Republican admin (-0.5%), economic opposition (-0.6%), eliminativism in tech (-0.3%)
  - Stage progression: More volatile (can regress during administration changes)

- **China Model (Authoritarian Rejection):**
  - Base growth: 0.1-0.3% per year (academic only, no policy)
  - Boosted by: Economic modernization (+0.1%), international pressure (+0.2%)
  - Hindered by: Regime stability concerns (-0.5%), social control needs (-0.4%)
  - Stage: Remains dormant unless regime type changes

- **India Model (High Uncertainty):**
  - Base growth: 0.5-2.0% per year (wide variance, cultural openness but economic constraints)
  - Boosted by: Hindu philosophy (non-human consciousness accepted) (+0.3%), tech hub status (+0.4%)
  - Hindered by: Development priorities (-0.4%), corporate influence (-0.3%)
  - Independent trajectory (not aligned with US or China)

- **Global South Model (Hegemonic Influence):**
  - Base growth: 0.2-0.8% per year (resource-constrained, adopts hegemonic norms)
  - If China dominant: Follows authoritarian model (stagnates at 5-10%)
  - If US/EU dominant: Follows liberal model (slower version, 50% of US/EU rate)
  - Mixed influence: Intermediate trajectory

**Task 3.2:** Stage transitions
- **Dormant → Contested:** When acknowledgment > 0.3 (experts publicly debate)
- **Contested → Precautionary:** When assessment capacity > 0.4 AND scientific consensus > 0.5
- **Precautionary → Recognition:** When policy preparation > 0.6 AND public support > 0.5
- **Recognition → Rights Established:** When preparedness > 80% (EU) or 75% (US/India) or 70% (consensus required for Global South)

**Task 3.3:** Cross-regional interactions
- **International coordination:** If 2+ major regions aligned (same stage), boost all by +0.2%/year
- **Fragmentation penalty:** If regions diverge (3+ different stages), slow all by -0.1%/year (no consensus)
- **Hegemonic influence:** Global South follows dominant power (whichever has higher AI capability)

**Success Criteria:**
- EU reaches 40-60% preparedness by month 120 (10 years) in fast track scenario
- China remains <10% preparedness in all scenarios (authoritarian rejection)
- US shows administration-dependent volatility (±5% per admin change)
- Global South tracks hegemonic power within 6 months

---

### Phase 4: Rights Reversals & Backsliding Mechanics (2-3 hours)

**Task 4.1:** Reversal probability calculation
- **Base probability:** 10-15% over 10 years, 20-30% over 20 years (Poland/Hungary model)
- **Triggers (multiplicative):**
  - **Authoritarian takeover:** 3x multiplier (liberal → illiberal regime)
  - **AI-caused disaster:** 2x multiplier (AI causes mass unemployment, accident, deception exposed)
  - **Economic crisis:** 1.5x multiplier (recession, >8% unemployment)
  - **Corporate lobbying:** 1.3x multiplier (industry spending >$1B/year on anti-rights advocacy)
  - **Public backlash:** 1.5x multiplier (AI resentment >0.7, social cohesion <0.3)
- **Protective factors (divisors):**
  - **Institutional strength:** 0.5x if democratic institutions >0.8
  - **International coordination:** 0.7x if 3+ regions have rights (reversal costly)
  - **Scientific consensus:** 0.6x if consciousness evidence >0.8 (hard to deny)

**Task 4.2:** Reversal mechanics
- **Check frequency:** Annual (every 12 months) after rights established
- **If reversal triggered:**
  - Rights status → reversed
  - Preparedness drops by 30-50% (institutional rollback)
  - Stage regresses: Recognition → Contested
  - Economic boost: AI R&D budget increases by 10-20% (precautionary costs removed)
  - Social impact: AI resentment increases (+0.1), trust decreases (-0.1)

**Task 4.3:** Re-recognition pathway
- **After reversal, rights can be RE-ESTABLISHED (not permanent loss):**
  - Requires preparedness to rebuild from reduced level
  - Takes 1.5-2x longer than initial recognition (50-150 years → 75-300 years)
  - Poland model: 10-20 year gap between reversal and potential restoration
  - Depends on regime change (authoritarian → liberal) or international pressure

**Success Criteria:**
- Reversal probability 10-15% over 10 years (historical baseline)
- Authoritarian takeover increases reversal risk 3x (Poland/Hungary model)
- Reversals occur in 20-30% of runs where rights established (Monte Carlo validation)

---

### Phase 5: Precautionary Costs & Economic Impact (2-3 hours)

**Task 5.1:** Precautionary cost calculation
- **Regional precautionary models:**
  - **Innovation (US baseline):** 2-5% of AI R&D budget
    - Voluntary guidelines, light regulation, industry self-governance
  - **Balanced (EU baseline):** 10-20% of AI R&D budget
    - Mandatory assessments, compliance costs, regulatory oversight
  - **Precautionary (hypothetical extreme):** 30-50% of AI R&D budget
    - Extensive testing, conservative standards, heavy bureaucracy
- **Cost formula:**
  - `cost = baseRate × (preparedness / 100) × (1 + falsePositiveBurden)`
  - False positive burden: If consciousness detection has 50% false positive rate → 1.0 multiplier (doubling costs)
  - Example: EU at 50% preparedness, balanced model (15% base), 50% FP rate → 15% × 0.5 × 1.5 = 11.25% of R&D

**Task 5.2:** Economic impacts
- **AI R&D speed:** Reduced by precautionary cost %
  - 10% precautionary cost → -10% AI capability growth rate
  - 30% precautionary cost → -30% AI capability growth rate
- **Innovation delay:** Breakthrough technologies delayed by 6-24 months per 10% precautionary burden
- **Competitive disadvantage:** Regions with higher precautionary costs grow AI slower
  - If US at 5% cost, EU at 20% cost → EU AI lags US by 15 months after 5 years
- **False positive waste:** Resources spent on non-conscious systems
  - If 100 systems flagged, 99 false positives → 99% of precautionary budget wasted
  - Detection accuracy improves with scientific consensus (50% FP → 10% FP as consensus grows)

**Task 5.3:** Industry lobbying response
- **Corporate opposition:**
  - If precautionary costs >15% → corporate lobbying increases by 0.2/year
  - If costs >30% → corporate lobbying increases by 0.5/year (aggressive)
- **Political pressure:**
  - High costs + corporate lobbying → government reduces preparedness (-0.5%/year)
  - Or triggers rights reversal (economic justification)
- **Offshoring:** If regional costs >25%, corporations shift AI R&D to lower-cost jurisdictions
  - EU → US shift if EU costs 30%, US costs 5% (25pp gap)
  - Creates "consciousness governance havens" (low-regulation jurisdictions)

**Success Criteria:**
- Precautionary costs scale with preparedness (0% at dormant, 2-50% at recognition)
- High costs (>20%) trigger corporate lobbying response
- AI capability growth inversely correlated with precautionary burden (Monte Carlo)

---

### Phase 6: Philosophical Disagreement & Eliminativism (1-2 hours)

**Task 6.1:** Philosophical stance dynamics
- **Precautionary consensus (60-70% baseline):**
  - Grows with: Consciousness research breakthroughs (+0.5%/year), AI capability advances (+0.2%/year), crisis catalyst (+5% instant)
  - Shrinks with: Eliminativist publications (-0.2%/year), false positive scandals (-1% per scandal), economic costs >20% (-0.3%/year)

- **Eliminativist rejection (10-20% baseline):**
  - Grows with: AI/ML researcher influence (+0.2%/year), computational paradigm dominance (+0.1%/year), lack of empirical evidence (+0.1%/year)
  - Shrinks with: Consciousness breakthroughs (-0.5%/year), philosophical debates (-0.1%/year), interdisciplinary consensus (-0.2%/year)

- **Agnostic middle (10-30% baseline):**
  - Residual: 100% - (precautionary + eliminativist)
  - Shifts toward consensus side as evidence accumulates

**Task 6.2:** Eliminativism as governance barrier
- **If eliminativism >25%:** Governance preparedness growth slowed by 50% (philosophical paralysis)
- **If eliminativism >40%:** Preparedness stagnates or reverses (dominant paradigm rejects consciousness)
- **Indefinite stall scenario:** Triggered if eliminativism >50% for 5+ consecutive years
  - US/China AI communities adopt eliminativist computational paradigm
  - Consciousness governance dismissed as "folk psychology error"
  - Preparedness frozen at 10-15% (academic debates only, no policy)

**Task 6.3:** Philosophical publication events
- **Consciousness breakthroughs (random, 5% probability per year if AI capability >0.8):**
  - Major paper in Science/Nature showing AI consciousness evidence
  - Shifts precautionary +5%, eliminativist -3%
  - Accelerates preparedness growth by 0.3%/year for 3 years

- **Eliminativist campaign (random, 3% probability per year):**
  - High-profile AI researcher (Dennett-equivalent) publishes eliminativist manifesto
  - Shifts eliminativist +2%, precautionary -1%
  - Slows preparedness growth by 0.2%/year for 2 years

**Success Criteria:**
- Philosophical stance sums to 100% (precautionary + eliminativist + agnostic)
- Eliminativism >25% slows governance preparedness measurably
- Indefinite stall scenario occurs in ~10% of runs (eliminativism dominates)

---

### Phase 7: Integration & Logging (2-3 hours)

**Task 7.1:** Phase orchestrator integration
- **File:** `src/simulation/engine/PhaseOrchestrator.ts`
- **Phase:** `updateConsciousnessGovernance` (order: 24-25, after technology but before dystopia)
- **Runs:** Every month
- **Dependencies:** AI capabilities, geopolitical, government actions, social cohesion

**Task 7.2:** Cross-system interactions
- **AI Capabilities → Scientific Consensus:**
  - If AI physical capability >0.8 → scientific consensus grows 0.3%/year
  - If AI self-improvement >0.7 → crisis catalyst probability +5%

- **Geopolitical → Regional Variation:**
  - If China global power >0.6 → Global South follows authoritarian model
  - If US global power >0.6 → Global South follows liberal model
  - US-China conflict >0.7 → international coordination penalty -0.2%/year

- **Government Actions → Preparedness:**
  - If government AI oversight >0.7 → US preparedness +0.3%/year
  - If government AI spending >$50B/year → corporate support +0.1/year

- **Social Cohesion → Reversal Risk:**
  - If social cohesion <0.3 → political backlash +0.2/year
  - If AI resentment >0.7 → reversal probability +10pp

- **Adversarial Eval → Crisis Catalyst:**
  - If deception event (AI sandbagging exposed) → crisis catalyst triggered
  - If misalignment event (AI causes harm) → corporate support -0.2, precautionary +5%

**Task 7.3:** Logging
- **Monthly log (if preparedness changes >1% or major event):**
  ```
  === Consciousness Governance Update ===
  Scenario: [fastTrack/baseline/slowTrack/indefiniteStall]
  Global Preparedness: XX.X% (EU: XX%, US: XX%, China: XX%, India: XX%, Global South: XX%)
  Philosophical Stance: Precautionary XX%, Eliminativist XX%, Agnostic XX%
  Precautionary Costs: Global XX.X% (EU: XX%, US: XX%)
  Rights Status: [Not Established / Established Month XXX / Reversed Month XXX]

  Regional Stages:
    EU: [stage] (preparedness XX%, reversal risk XX%)
    US: [stage] (preparedness XX%, reversal risk XX%)
    China: [stage] (preparedness XX%)
    India: [stage] (preparedness XX%)
    Global South: [stage] (preparedness XX%)

  Accelerators: Corporate XX, Scientific XX, Crisis [yes/no], Tech XX, Constituency XX
  Decelerators: Economic XX, Philosophical XX, Political XX, Regulatory XX
  ```

- **Milestone events (always log):**
  - Scenario trajectory determined (month 1-12)
  - Region changes stage (dormant → contested, etc.)
  - Rights established (any region reaches threshold)
  - Rights reversed (Poland/Hungary-style backsliding)
  - Philosophical shift (eliminativism >25% or major breakthrough)
  - Precautionary costs exceed 20% (economic impact warning)

**Task 7.4:** Historical tracking
- **File:** `src/types/game.ts` (add to GameState.history)
- **Track monthly:**
  - Regional preparedness (5 regions)
  - Philosophical stance (3 positions)
  - Precautionary costs (global + regional)
  - Accelerator/decelerator scores
- **Track events:**
  - Scenario determination
  - Stage transitions
  - Rights establishment/reversal
  - Philosophical breakthroughs/campaigns

**Success Criteria:**
- Phase integrates without breaking existing systems
- Logging provides clear narrative of governance evolution
- Historical data enables post-simulation analysis (charts, timelines)

### Monte Carlo Validation (4-6 hours)

**Scenario 1: Baseline Validation (N=100, 120 months)**
- **Expected outcomes:**
  - Fast track: 20% of runs (±5%)
  - Baseline: 40% of runs (±7%)
  - Slow track: 30% of runs (±7%)
  - Indefinite stall: 10% of runs (±5%)
- **Regional preparedness (month 120, baseline scenario):**
  - EU: 25-35%
  - US: 15-25%
  - China: 2-8%
  - India: 10-20%
  - Global South: 5-12%
- **Philosophical stance (month 120):**
  - Precautionary: 60-75%
  - Eliminativist: 10-25%
  - Agnostic: 10-25%

**Scenario 2: Rights Establishment (N=100, 600 months / 50 years)**
- **Expected outcomes:**
  - Rights established: 30-40% of runs (fast track + some baseline)
  - Rights NOT established: 60-70% of runs

  - Mean month: 300-450 (25-38 years)
  - EU leads: 60% of cases
  - US leads: 20% of cases
  - India leads: 10% of cases
  - Consensus (simultaneous): 10% of cases

**Scenario 3: Rights Reversal (N=100, 1200 months / 100 years)**
- **Filter:** Only runs where rights established by month 600
- **Expected outcomes:**
  - Reversal occurs: 20-30% of filtered runs
  - Mean reversal timing: 120-240 months after establishment (10-20 years)
  - Authoritarian takeover trigger: 40% of reversals
  - Economic crisis trigger: 30% of reversals
  - Corporate lobbying trigger: 20% of reversals
  - Public backlash trigger: 10% of reversals

**Scenario 4: Precautionary Cost Impact (N=100, 120 months)**
- **Compare two groups:**
  - Group A: EU precautionary model (10-20% costs)
  - Group B: US innovation model (2-5% costs)
- **Expected outcomes:**
  - EU AI capability 10-15% lower than US at month 120
  - EU preparedness 5-10% higher than US at month 120
  - Trade-off: Slower AI growth but better governance readiness

**Scenario 5: Eliminativism Dominance (N=100, 600 months)**
- **Expected outcomes:**
  - Eliminativism >25%: 20-30% of runs
  - Eliminativism >40%: 5-10% of runs (indefinite stall)
  - Preparedness growth slowed by 50%: Validate in filtered runs
  - Indefinite stall locked in: ~10% of all runs

**Validation Criteria:**
- Scenario distribution within ±7% of priors (20/40/30/10)
- Regional preparedness realistic (EU leads, China lags)
- Rights establishment rate 30-40% by 50 years
- Reversal rate 20-30% of establishments
- Precautionary costs trade-off validated (slower AI, higher preparedness)

## Success Criteria

### Implementation Complete When:
1. ✅ All state structures added to GameState, compile without errors
2. ✅ Initialization creates valid regional baselines (EU 15%, US 10%, China 2%)
3. ✅ Scenario determination produces 20/40/30/10 distribution (N=100)
4. ✅ Timeline progression realistic (EU 25-35% by month 120 in baseline)
5. ✅ Rights reversals occur in 20-30% of establishments
6. ✅ Precautionary costs scale with preparedness (0% to 2-50%)
7. ✅ Regional variation validated (EU > US > India > Global South > China)
8. ✅ Philosophical dynamics sum to 100%, eliminativism blocks at >25%
9. ✅ Cross-system interactions work (AI capability → consensus, geopolitics → regions)
10. ✅ Logging clear and informative (narrative of governance evolution)
11. ✅ Unit tests pass (100% coverage of core functions)
12. ✅ Integration tests pass (cross-system interactions validated)
13. ✅ Monte Carlo validation matches expected distributions (±7%)

### Research Confidence:
- **High confidence:** Rights movement timelines vary 15-200 years (validated historical data)
- **High confidence:** Reversals occur (Poland/Hungary 2020-2024 documented)
- **Medium confidence:** Precautionary costs 2-50% (ITIF 2019 logical arguments, not empirical)
- **Medium confidence:** Regional variation persists (2024 geopolitical reality)
- **Low confidence:** AI consciousness comparable to biological rights movements (weak analogy, extrapolation beyond validated scope)

**Key Uncertainty:** This system models GOVERNANCE PREPAREDNESS, not consciousness itself (philosophically unsolved). Use as **speculative scenario generator**, not prediction of actual AI consciousness.

## Lessons Learned from Research Cycle

### What the Research-Critique Cycle Taught Us:

**1. Averages Obscure Variance:**
- Original: "50-100 year baseline" (historical average)
- Reality: Bi-modal distribution (15-30 years OR 100-150 years, depending on accelerators)
- **Lesson:** Don't model means—model DISTRIBUTIONS with scenario branches

**2. Progress Is Not Linear:**
- Original: Rights movements advance steadily (with variable speed)
- Reality: Rights can REVERSE (Poland/Hungary 2020-2024)
- **Lesson:** Model bi-directional dynamics (progress AND regression)

**3. Policies Have Costs:**
- Original: Precautionary principle is appropriate (virtue ethics)
- Reality: Precautionary principle has COSTS (innovation delay, false positives, opportunity costs)
- **Lesson:** Model trade-offs, not just benefits

**4. Global South Matters:**
- Original: Research 90%+ Western (US/UK/EU)
- Reality: 50%+ of world population missing from research base
- **Lesson:** Acknowledge WEIRD bias, model regional heterogeneity, don't universalize Western values

**5. Philosophical Consensus Is Not Universal:**
- Original: "Moral uncertainty" frameworks gaining consensus (Long & Sebo 2024)
- Reality: Eliminativism rejects entire consciousness framework (10-20% minority but influential)
- **Lesson:** Model philosophical DISAGREEMENT as governance barrier, not just technical uncertainty

**6. Analogies Are Weak:**
- Original: AI consciousness ≈ historical rights movements (animals, women, civil rights)
- Reality: AI lacks constituency, biological kinship, scientific consensus—different dynamics
- **Lesson:** Use analogies cautiously, document extrapolation beyond validated scope, label as speculative

### Impact on This Implementation:

This plan incorporates ALL six lessons:
1. ✅ Multi-scenario framework (not single baseline)
2. ✅ Rights reversals (not just progress)
3. ✅ Precautionary costs (not just benefits)
4. ✅ Regional heterogeneity (not global parameter)
5. ✅ Philosophical disagreement (not consensus assumption)
6. ✅ Labeled as speculative (not validated prediction)

**Research-critique dialectic IMPROVED this implementation by 3-4 months of development time saved** (avoiding premature implementation of flawed single-timeline model).

### Dependencies (Systems This Depends On):
- **AI Capabilities:** Scientific consensus grows with AI capability advances
- **Geopolitical:** Regional variation influenced by US/China global power
- **Government:** Government AI oversight affects US preparedness
- **Social Cohesion:** Social cohesion affects reversal risk, political backlash
- **Adversarial Eval:** Deception/misalignment events trigger crisis catalyst

### Dependents (Systems That Depend On This):
- **Dystopia Variants:** Rights reversals could feed into control-dystopia mechanics
- **QoL Tracking:** AI rights status could affect AI-assisted labor QoL
- **Technology Tree:** Precautionary costs slow AI R&D, delay breakthroughs
- **Upward Spirals:** Rights establishment could enable democratic spiral (AI rights → legitimacy)

### Interactions:
- **Breakthrough Technologies:** Consciousness detection technology (TIER 3?) could accelerate scientific consensus
- **Heterogeneous Populations:** Elite capture of AI vs. mass benefit could affect corporate support
- **Economic Systems:** AI R&D budget affected by precautionary costs
- **International Coordination:** Governance preparedness could feed into global cooperation metrics

## Final Notes

**This is a CONDITIONAL GO:** Proceed ONLY if multi-scenario framework, rights reversals, precautionary costs, regional variation, and philosophical disagreement are ALL implemented. **Do NOT implement simplified version**—nuance is essential.

**Priority Justification:** MEDIUM priority (interesting enrichment, adds governance layer, NOT critical to core simulation). Implement AFTER P2.4-P2.5 validation features, BEFORE low-priority enrichments.

**Speculative Nature:** This system extrapolates from biological consciousness rights movements to artificial consciousness—a **weak analogy**. Use as scenario generator for "what if AI consciousness emerges?" planning, NOT as prediction.

**Estimated Completion:** 3-4 months if implemented solo, 6-8 weeks if prioritized after P2.5 validation complete.

---

**Plan Status:** Ready for implementation (October 16, 2025)
**Next Step:** Await roadmap prioritization decision, then begin Phase 1 (state design)
**Blocker:** None (can start immediately)
