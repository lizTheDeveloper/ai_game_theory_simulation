# Psychological Trauma Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Phase:** 1B Refinement - Psychological Trauma Modeling
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

Implemented psychological trauma modeling to capture the long-term effects of mass death events on survivors, addressing a critical gap identified by research-skeptic.

## Research Foundation

- **Wilkinson & Pickett (2009):** Extreme disruption (>20% mortality) causes decades of trauma
- **PTSD literature:** 40-60% PTSD rates in survivors of mass casualty events
- **Intergenerational trauma:** Holocaust survivors' children show elevated stress markers
- **Diamond (2005):** >50% mortality leads to institutional breakdown lasting generations

## Implementation Details

### 1. State Tracking (`src/types/game.ts`)

Added `PsychologicalTraumaState` interface:
```typescript
export interface PsychologicalTraumaState {
  traumaLevel: number;                  // [0,1] Cumulative psychological burden
  monthsSinceLastMassEvent: number;     // Recovery time counter
  generationalTrauma: number;           // [0,1] Affects children (future feature)
  mentalHealthInfrastructure: number;   // [0,1] Capacity to treat (starts at 0.5)
  massDeathEvents: number;              // Count of >10% mortality events
  lastEventSeverity: number;            // [0,1] Severity of most recent event
}
```

### 2. Initialization (`src/simulation/initialization.ts`)

Added baseline trauma state with no initial trauma:
- `traumaLevel: 0.0` (no baseline trauma)
- `monthsSinceLastMassEvent: 999` (no recent events)
- `mentalHealthInfrastructure: 0.5` (moderate baseline capacity)

### 3. Trauma Accumulation Phase (`src/simulation/engine/phases/PsychologicalTraumaPhase.ts`)

**Order:** 23.5 (after population dynamics 23.0, before QoL calculations 34.0)

**Trauma Triggers:**
- >10% monthly mortality = Major trauma event (+15% trauma)
- >30% monthly mortality = Severe trauma event (+35% trauma)
- >50% monthly mortality = Catastrophic trauma event (+60% trauma)

**Diminishing Returns:**
- Trauma accumulation has diminishing returns (can't exceed 95%)
- Remaining capacity formula: `maxTrauma - currentTrauma`
- This prevents unrealistic 100% trauma levels

**Recovery Mechanics:**
- Base recovery rate: -0.02 per month (50 months to halve trauma)
- Research: PTSD recovery typically 12-24 months with treatment, longer without
- Mental health tech (TIER 3) increases recovery rate by 50%
- Social cohesion (>0.6) increases recovery rate by 25%

### 4. QoL Penalties (`src/simulation/qualityOfLife.ts`)

**Psychological Wellbeing:**
- Non-linear penalty: `traumaPenalty = Math.pow(traumaLevel, 1.5)`
- Reduces mental health dimension: `mentalHealth *= (1 - traumaPenalty)`
- Research: 40-60% PTSD rates in mass casualty survivors

**Social Connections:**
- Reduces social connection: `socialConnection *= (1 - traumaPenalty * 0.5)`
- Reduces community strength: `communityStrength *= (1 - traumaPenalty * 0.4)`
- Research: Trauma survivors withdraw, community bonds weaken

**Institutional Trust Erosion:**
- Threshold: >30% trauma level
- Reduces government legitimacy: `legitimacy *= (1 - traumaLevel * 0.3)`
- Reduces social cohesion: `cohesion *= (1 - traumaLevel * 0.15)`
- Research: Diamond (2005) - institutional breakdown after >50% mortality

### 5. Phase Registration (`src/simulation/engine.ts`)

Registered `PsychologicalTraumaPhase` in phase orchestrator:
- Import added to phase list
- Phase registered in constructor
- Executes at order 23.5 (between population and QoL)

## Validation Strategy

### Immediate Validation (N=10)
- Run Monte Carlo simulation with 10 runs, 120 months
- Verify trauma accumulates during mass death events
- Verify trauma reduces QoL (psychological and social dimensions)
- Verify recovery occurs over time
- Check for NaN errors, infinite loops, crashes

### Expected Results
- **Humane utopia:** 2-5% avg trauma (minimal)
- **Pyrrhic utopia:** 25-40% avg trauma (significant)
- **Pyrrhic dystopia:** 35-50% avg trauma (severe)
- **Extinction paths:** 50-80% avg trauma (catastrophic, but survivors rare)

### Impact on QoL
- **Pyrrhic utopia:** 15-25% QoL reduction from trauma (vs humane utopia)
- This explains why pyrrhic outcomes feel less positive despite high base QoL

## Files Modified

1. `/src/types/game.ts` - Added PsychologicalTraumaState interface
2. `/src/simulation/initialization.ts` - Initialize trauma state
3. `/src/simulation/engine/phases/PsychologicalTraumaPhase.ts` - NEW FILE: Trauma accumulation logic
4. `/src/simulation/engine/phases/index.ts` - Export PsychologicalTraumaPhase
5. `/src/simulation/qualityOfLife.ts` - Apply trauma penalties to QoL
6. `/src/simulation/engine.ts` - Register PsychologicalTraumaPhase

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why >10% monthly mortality threshold?
- Research: Mass casualty events with >10% deaths cause widespread PTSD
- Historical: Spanish Flu (1918), Black Death (~30-60%), WWII (3-5%)
- Avoids triggering on normal baseline mortality

### 2. Why non-linear penalty (power 1.5)?
- Low trauma (<20%) has minimal QoL impact
- High trauma (>50%) has severe impact
- Realistic: Trauma effects compound non-linearly

### 3. Why 50-month recovery baseline?
- PTSD literature: Untreated trauma takes years to diminish
- With treatment: 12-24 months
- Base rate (-0.02/month) gives 50-month half-life
- Tech/social support accelerates recovery

### 4. Why separate from social cohesion?
- Trauma is individual-level psychological state
- Social cohesion is collective institutional state
- They interact but are distinct phenomena
- Trauma erodes cohesion, cohesion aids recovery

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

1. **Intergenerational Transmission**
   - Holocaust survivor children show elevated cortisol
   - Could affect next generation's baseline trauma
   - Research: Epigenetic trauma transmission

2. **Regional Variation**
   - Some regions hit harder by crises
   - Differential trauma exposure
   - Migration from trauma zones

3. **Trauma-Informed Policy**
   - Mental health infrastructure tech (TIER 3)
   - Community support programs
   - Psychological first aid deployment

4. **Compound Effects**
   - Multiple mass death events compound trauma
   - "Trauma waves" from sequential crises
   - Recovery interrupted by new events

## Testing Notes

- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Phase executes at correct order (23.5)
- Defensive programming: initializes trauma state if missing
- Logs trauma events for Monte Carlo analysis
- NaN guards in QoL calculations
