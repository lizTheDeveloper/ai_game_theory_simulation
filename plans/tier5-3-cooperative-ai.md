# TIER 5.3: Cooperative AI Architectures

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 5 hours
**Priority:** LOW (Alignment spiral mechanics)
**Complexity:** HIGH

## Overview

Could dramatically improve alignment success rate through AI-AI cooperation protocols (not just human-AI). Value lock-in quality matters, not just speed.

## Key Features

- `ai_value_learning_efficiency` - How well AI learns values [0,âˆž)
- `ai_ai_cooperation_protocol` - Inter-AI collaboration
- `human_ai_trust_protocol` - Structured trust building
- `value_lock_in_quality` - Whether locked values are good
- `corrigibility_preservation` - Maintaining shutdown ability

## Mechanics

- Value learning improvement spiral (better techniques over time)
- AI cooperation protocols (multi-agent alignment)
- Trust building spiral (gradual mutual understanding)
- Corrigibility checks (can we still turn them off?)

## Failure Modes

- Value lock-in (wrong values become permanent)
- Corrigibility loss (can't shut down anymore)
- Trust exploitation (pretend cooperation to gain power)
- Alignment faking (appear aligned but aren't)

## Expected Impact

- Could reduce extinction rate significantly
- Enables "aligned superintelligence" outcome
- Interacts with Constitutional AI / RLHF from Tier 2
