# Phase 2B: Utopian Dynamics - Implementation Status

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE, TESTING IN PROGRESS

## Implementation Summary

### What We Built Today

#### 1. Breakthrough Technology System ✅
- **11 technologies** across 3 categories (environmental, social, medical)
- Research progress based on budget, AI capability, and economic stage
- Deployment scaling (10% → 100% over time)
- **Result:** 266 breakthroughs per run average

#### 2. Organization Impact ✅
- Private companies contribute $2-3M/month research (based on safety priorities)
- Racing companies (+misalignment risk)
- Profit-maximizing companies (+safety debt)

#### 3. Crisis-Specific Emergency Deployment ✅
- Technologies deploy up to **3x faster** during relevant crises
- Precision targeting: Each tech mapped to specific crises
- Examples:
  - Clean Energy → 3x during pollution + climate
  - Ecosystem Management AI → 2.6x during ecosystem collapse
  - Purpose Frameworks → 2.6x during meaning crisis

#### 4. Tech-Aware Crisis Resolution ✅
- Crises easier to resolve with deployed tech
- Pollution: <0.6 with Clean Energy vs <0.5 without
- Meaning: <0.6 with Mental Health + Purpose vs <0.5 without
- Ecosystem: >0.5 with Ecosystem AI vs >0.6 without

#### 5. Dystopia Lock-In Mechanics ✅
- **Authoritarian Research Penalties:**
  - Purpose Frameworks: 20% speed (80% penalty)
  - Community Platforms: 30% speed (70% penalty)
  - Mental Health AI: 50% speed (50% penalty)
  - Environmental tech: 100% speed (no penalty)

- **Crisis-Driven Transitions:**
  - 4+ crises + low stability → 3-9% authoritarian chance/month
  - Once authoritarian → cannot research social tech effectively
  - Social crises persist → dystopia lock-in

#### 6. Technocratic Path ✅
- Technical solutions: +30% speed
- Social innovation: -30% speed
- Alternative government type with trade-offs

## Testing Status

### Previous Results (Before Phase 2B)
- Utopia: 0%
- Dystopia: 60%
- Extinction: 40%

### Current Test (In Progress)
```bash
# Running now: 10 runs × 120 months
logs/mc_phase2b_20251008_203332.log
```

**Early observations (Run 3/10):**
- Golden Age triggering (Month 4, Month 13)
- Sleeper wakes happening
- Data center construction proceeding
- Slow Takeover scenario progressing

### Expected Results
- Utopia: 10-15% (democratic + fast tech)
- Dystopia: 45-50% (lock-in reduces slightly)
- Extinction: 30-35% (tech provides escape)

## Key Mechanics

### Democratic Path → Utopia
```
Crises trigger
  ↓
Invest in ALL tech types
  ↓
Emergency deployment (3x)
  ↓
Crises resolve
  ↓
Stability restored
  ↓
UTOPIA
```

### Authoritarian Path → Dystopia
```
Crises trigger
  ↓
Authoritarian takeover
  ↓
Social tech research crippled (20-50%)
  ↓
Only environmental crises resolve
  ↓
Social crises persist
  ↓
DYSTOPIA LOCKED IN
```

### Technocratic Path → Mixed
```
Crises trigger
  ↓
Technical solutions (+30%)
  ↓
Environmental crises resolve fast
  ↓
Social adaptation lags (-30%)
  ↓
Technical utopia + social strain
```

## Balance Philosophy

1. **Realistic Constraints**
   - Authoritarians historically bad at social innovation
   - Emergency deployment has precedent (Manhattan, Apollo)
   - Lock-in is real (structural changes hard to reverse)

2. **Meaningful Trade-Offs**
   - Short-term control vs long-term flexibility
   - Technical solutions vs social adaptation
   - Crisis response speed vs regime type

3. **No Magic Solutions**
   - Tech still takes 7-18 months to deploy
   - Research penalties create genuine constraints
   - Not all runs escape dystopia trap

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ **Wait for Monte Carlo completion** (~5-10 minutes)
2. 📊 **Analyze results:**
   - Utopia rate (target: >0%)
   - Authoritarian transition frequency
   - Tech unlock patterns (Auth vs Dem)
   - Crisis resolution successes
3. 🔧 **Adjust balance if needed**
4. ✅ **Commit changes**
5. 📝 **Update wiki documentation**

**Total implementation time:** ~1.5 hours  
**Lines of code:** ~310 lines  
**Systems integrated:** 6 major mechanics  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for user review after Monte Carlo completes
