# Master Implementation Roadmap
## AI Game Theory Simulation

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL FIXES IN PROGRESS

---

## Current Priority: P0 - Restore Monte Carlo Variance

**Goal:** Fix deterministic mechanics causing 100% convergence in Monte Carlo runs

### ✅ COMPLETED (Oct 15, 2025)

1. **P0.1: AI Capability Growth Rate** (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)
   - Moore's Law: 2.7% → 9.05% monthly growth
   - Compute scaling: 7,943x over 10 years (was 2.4x)
   - Recursive self-improvement added for AGI acceleration

2. **P0.2: Organization Bankruptcy Paradox** (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)
   - Fixed impossible revenue generation by bankrupt organizations
   - Economic conservation laws now respected

3. **P0.3: Cascade Trigger Stochasticity** (commit 7386c4d)
   - Replaced deterministic threshold with probabilistic trigger (0-10% monthly chance)
   - Verified working: Cascade triggered at Month 13 with 9.22% probability
   - **⚠️ INSUFFICIENT:** All 10 Monte Carlo runs still converge to identical 0.34B population

### 🔴 IN PROGRESS

4. **P0.4: Investigate Remaining Determinism** (URGENT - Next Task)
   - Add diagnostic logging to trace deterministic systems
   - Compare 3-5 Monte Carlo runs to identify identical metrics
   - Priority areas: population mortality, resource depletion, environmental degradation
   - **Blocker:** Until resolved, Monte Carlo analysis is invalid
   - See: [Implementation Plan P0.4](/Users/annhoward/src/superalignmenttoutopia/plans/implementation_plan_20251015.md#p04-investigate-remaining-sources-of-determinism-4-6-hours)

5. **P0.5: Crisis Mortality Stochasticity** (BLOCKED by P0.4)
   - Add random variation to mortality rates (±20-40%)
   - Apply to famine, disease, climate, ecosystem deaths
   - Target: Monthly mortality varies across runs, not identical

6. **P0.6: Resource Dynamics Stochasticity** (BLOCKED by P0.4)
   - Add weather/efficiency variation to resource depletion (±20-30%)
   - Add catastrophic event probability (droughts, harvest failures)
   - Target: Resource trajectories diverge across runs

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 10-run Monte Carlo shows population variance >20% (currently 0%)
- [ ] Population endpoints range: 0.3B to 3B (currently all identical at 0.34B)
- [ ] Some runs avoid cascade entirely (currently 100% trigger)

**Timeline:** Complete P0.4-P0.6 within 2-3 days (10-14 hours remaining)

---

## Next Up: P1 - Achieve Research-Grade Realism

**Start After:** P0.4-P0.6 complete and Monte Carlo variance verified

### Priority Fixes (1 week, 20-25 hours)

1. **P1.1: Debug Death Accounting**
   - Fix missing 97% of deaths in reporting (6.8B decline, only 0.2B tracked)
   - Trace death flow from calculation to aggregation

2. **P1.2: Reduce Cascade Mortality Rate**
   - Current: 2% monthly = 62% dead in 4 years (3-6x worse than Black Death)
   - Target: 0.5-1% monthly = 6-12% annual (match historical precedent)

3. **P1.3: Reduce Cascading Failure Multiplier**
   - Current: 6 crises = 3.0x degradation (unrealistic doom loop)
   - Target: 6 crises = 1.8x degradation (severe but not irreversible)

4. **P1.4: Fix False Extinction Detection**
   - Current: Reports "extinction" with 1.14B survivors
   - Target: Use actual population (<10K = extinction, <100M = bottleneck)

5. **P1.5: Add Basic Recovery Mechanics**
   - Post-crisis birth rate spikes (baby boom effect)
   - Ecosystem regeneration when population pressure reduces
   - Target: 5-10% of runs show recovery after bottleneck

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Death accounting: Sum of categories = population decline (±5%)
- [ ] Mortality rates: Match Black Death severity (30-60% over 6-10 years)
- [ ] Final population: 2B-4B in severe runs (not 0.3B-1B)
- [ ] Some runs show stabilization and recovery (not 100% irreversible decline)

## Future Priorities

### P2: Publication-Ready Quality (2-4 weeks)

1. **Recalibrate Environmental Degradation** - Match IPCC/IPBES rates (currently 100-1000x too fast)
2. **Stochastic Innovation/Breakthroughs** - Add miracle technologies that can avert catastrophe
3. **Heterogeneous Population Segments** - Model societal polarization, elite/mass gaps
4. **Organization Geographic Diversification** - Multi-national companies survive better
5. **Historical Validation** - Reproduce COVID-19, 2008 crisis, Black Death trajectories

See: [Implementation Plan P2](/Users/annhoward/src/superalignmenttoutopia/plans/implementation_plan_20251015.md#priority-2-medium---improve-within-2-4-weeks)

### P3: State-of-the-Art Features (Optional, 4-8 weeks)

- Variable timesteps / event-driven architecture
- Unknown unknown event system
- Alignment model specificity
- Government implementation realism
- Continuous parameter uncertainty

See: [Implementation Plan P3](/Users/annhoward/src/superalignmenttoutopia/plans/implementation_plan_20251015.md#priority-3-low---nice-to-have-improvements)

## Critical Discovery (Oct 15, 2025)

**Problem:** After implementing stochastic cascade triggers (P0.3), all 10 Monte Carlo runs STILL converge to identical outcomes:
```
Run 1-10: BOTTLENECK → 0.34B population (95.7% decline) - EXACTLY IDENTICAL
```

**Analysis:** P0.3 fixed ONE source of determinism (cascade trigger timing), but the **consequences** of the cascade (mortality, resource depletion, economic collapse) remain deterministic. This overwhelms any trigger randomness.

**Action:** P0.4-P0.6 added to systematically identify and fix remaining deterministic mechanics.

**Impact:** Monte Carlo analysis is currently INVALID. All variance-dependent conclusions (probability distributions, outcome ranges, risk quantification) are unreliable until determinism is eliminated.

## Open Questions

### For P0.4 Investigation:

1. **Primary determinism source?** Population mortality vs resource depletion vs environmental degradation?
2. **Magnitude of stochasticity needed?** ±10%? ±30%? ±50%?
3. **Should randomness be correlated across systems?** (e.g., bad luck in mortality + bad luck in resources = extreme outcomes)
4. **Debug mode needed?** Log all random number generation to verify randomness is actually being used?

### For Planning:

1. Should P0.5-P0.6 add stochasticity blindly, or wait for P0.4 investigation results?
2. Are there other known deterministic systems beyond mortality/resources/environment?
3. What level of Monte Carlo variance is "sufficient"? (Target: >20%, but is 30-50% needed?)

---

## Recommendations

**Immediate Next Steps (Oct 15-18, 2025):**

1. **P0.4 Investigation (4-6 hours)**
   - Implement diagnostic logging in 5 key systems
   - Run 3-5 Monte Carlo runs with logging enabled
   - Compare outputs to identify IDENTICAL metrics (= deterministic systems)
   - Document specific line numbers and functions

2. **P0.5-P0.6 Implementation (4-6 hours)**
   - Add stochasticity to top 3 deterministic systems identified in P0.4
   - Use ±20-40% random variation for each system
   - Run 10-run Monte Carlo to verify variance

3. **Validation (1-2 hours)**
   - Verify population endpoints vary by >20%
   - Verify some runs avoid cascade (not 100% convergence)
   - If still converging, iterate on stochasticity magnitude

**If P0.6 complete and still converging:**
- Escalate for deeper investigation
- Consider structural changes (not just parameter variation)
- Review random seed implementation (verify seeds are actually different)
