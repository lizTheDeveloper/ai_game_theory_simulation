# TIER 5.2: Longevity & Space Expansion

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 6 hours
**Priority:** LOW (Long-term Utopia dimensions)
**Complexity:** MEDIUM

## Overview

Extends Scientific Spiral with dramatic breakthroughs. Addresses post-scarcity at cosmic scale and provides novel existential risk mitigation.

## Key Features

- `longevity_extension` - Additional healthy years [0,200]
- `space_expansion_capability` - Off-world development [0,âˆž)
- `fundamental_physics_understanding` - Deep reality comprehension [0,1]

## Mechanics

- Medical revolution: Aging reversal, disease cures
- Space expansion: Asteroid mining, Mars colonies, interstellar probes
- Resource uncapping: Space provides unlimited materials
- Existential risk reduction: -50% from multi-planet presence

## Failure Modes

- Immortal oligarchy (longevity without equality)
- Stagnation (immortals resist change)
- Existential experiments (playing with physics fundamentals)
- Wealth accumulation problem (compound interest forever)

## Expected Impact

- Could enable permanent Utopia (resources truly unlimited)
- Addresses resource constraints from Tier 1 crises
- Novel outcome: "Post-scarcity civilization" (beyond Earth)
