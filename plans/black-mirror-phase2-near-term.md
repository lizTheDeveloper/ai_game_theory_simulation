# Black Mirror Phase 2: Near-Term Development (3-6 months)

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 12-16 weeks
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Research-Backed Systems Needing Development Work

## Overview

Phase 2 integrates conditionally approved systems that require more architectural work, new system components, or validation research before full integration.

**Approval:** Conditional approval with safeguards after dialectic review process.

## Systems to Integrate

### 1. Enhanced Social Credit System (4 weeks)

**Why Phase 2:** High implementation complexity due to context-dependence

**Development Requirements:**
- Multi-context modeling (voluntary platforms vs state-mandated)
- Government type interaction (authoritarian vs democratic)
- Exit option modeling (opt-out resistance mechanisms)
- Cascade effects (threshold modeling, network amplification)

**Research Needed:**
- More granular data from Chinese pilots
- Cross-national comparison studies
- Opt-out community case studies

**Integration Points:**
- Authoritarian state mechanics
- Democratic resistance
- Social mobility/inequality

### 2. Parasocial AI Relationship System (3 weeks)

**Why Phase 2:** Requires new relationship modeling infrastructure

**Development Requirements:**
- Attachment formation mechanics (interaction frequency, emotional content)
- Competing relationship quality (substitution vs complementation)
- Bidirectional outcomes (therapeutic benefits AND potential harms)
- Commercial dynamics (subscription dependencies, data privacy)

**Research Needed:**
- Longitudinal data on AI companion use
- Therapeutic outcome studies
- Commercial model impact analysis

**Integration Points:**
- Social cohesion
- Mental health QoL dimension
- Loneliness crisis modeling
- Market dynamics

### 3. Memetic Contagion System (3 weeks)

**Why Phase 2:** Needs network infrastructure and bidirectional modeling

**Development Requirements:**
- Viral spread mechanics (R0 equivalent for memes: 2-8)
- Network structure effects
- Platform algorithm amplification/suppression
- **Bidirectional modeling** (positive virality: education, support movements; negative: misinformation, mob formation)
- Online-to-offline conversion thresholds

**Research Needed:**
- Viral spread rates across platforms
- Positive vs negative amplification asymmetries
- Intervention effectiveness studies

**Important:** Model information spread mechanics, NOT fictional memetic weapons. Focus on realistic cases like crowdfunding (positive) and hate campaigns (negative).

**Integration Points:**
- Information warfare system
- Social movements
- Political polarization
- Crisis contagion

### 4. Algorithmic Amplification System (3 weeks)

**Why Phase 2:** Requires careful bidirectional modeling

**Development Requirements:**
- Engagement optimization mechanics (clicks, time-on-site)
- **Bidirectional effects:** Educational content recommendation AND radicalization pipelines
- Personalization filter bubbles
- Intervention mechanisms (transparency, user control)

**Research Needed:**
- Amplification asymmetries (does negativity truly outperform positivity?)
- Filter bubble empirical evidence
- Platform intervention effectiveness

**Important:** Model BOTH positive (learning, community building) and negative (radicalization, polarization) effects.

**Integration Points:**
- Polarization dynamics
- Information integrity
- Democratic discourse quality
- Educational outcomes

## Timeline

**Months 3-4:** Enhanced Social Credit + Parasocial AI
**Months 5-6:** Memetic Contagion + Algorithmic Amplification
**Months 6-7:** Integration testing and validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Social credit context-dependence (voluntary vs state-mandated)
- [ ] Exit options modulate compliance rates
- [ ] Parasocial attachments form at realistic rates
- [ ] Therapeutic benefits and harms both modeled
- [ ] Memetic R0 matches empirical 2-8 range
- [ ] Online-to-offline conversion at 0.001-0.01 base rate
- [ ] Algorithmic amplification shows both positive and negative effects
- [ ] Filter bubbles emerge from personalization

## Risk Mitigation

**For All Phase 2 Systems:**
- Include bidirectional modeling (positive AND negative outcomes)
- Avoid deterministic doom narratives
- Model interventions and resistance mechanisms
- Use empirical base rates, not fictional extremes
- Validate against real-world case studies
