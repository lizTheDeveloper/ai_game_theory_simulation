# P0 Progress Summary - October 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL SUCCESS - 3/6 P0 tasks complete, critical determinism issue discovered

### Completed Tasks (50%)

✅ **P0.1: AI Capability Growth Rate** (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)
- Moore's Law: 2.7% → 9.05% monthly growth
- Result: 7,943x compute growth over 10 years (was 2.4x)
- Impact: AGI scenarios now properly enabled

✅ **P0.2: Organization Bankruptcy Paradox** (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)
- Fixed impossible revenue generation by bankrupt organizations
- Result: Economic conservation laws now respected

✅ **P0.3: Cascade Trigger Stochasticity** (commit 7386c4d)
- Replaced deterministic threshold with probabilistic trigger
- Result: Cascade triggered at Month 13 with 9.22% probability (was deterministic at Month 12)
- **⚠️ INSUFFICIENT:** See critical discovery below

### Critical Discovery

Despite P0.3 successfully implementing stochastic cascade triggers, **all 10 Monte Carlo runs still converge to IDENTICAL outcomes:**

```
Run 1-10: BOTTLENECK → 0.34B population (95.7% decline) - EXACTLY IDENTICAL
```

**Analysis:** P0.3 fixed ONE source of determinism (cascade trigger timing), but the **consequences** of the cascade (population mortality, resource depletion, economic collapse) are likely deterministic formulas that produce identical results regardless of when the cascade triggers.

**Impact:** Monte Carlo analysis is currently INVALID. All variance-dependent conclusions are unreliable until determinism is eliminated.

## New Tasks Added (P0.4-P0.6)

### 🔴 P0.4: Investigate Remaining Sources of Determinism (URGENT)
**Priority:** Highest - blocks all other work
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Status:** Not started

**Approach:**
1. Add diagnostic logging to trace 5 key systems (population, resources, environment, economy, crises)
2. Run 3-5 Monte Carlo runs with logging enabled
3. Compare outputs to identify IDENTICAL metrics (= deterministic systems)
4. Document specific line numbers and functions causing convergence

**Investigation Areas:**
- Population mortality calculations (likely deterministic percentages)
- Resource depletion rates (food, water - may be fixed decline rates)
- Environmental degradation feedback loops (climate, biodiversity)
- Economic collapse mechanics (GDP multipliers, unemployment)
- Crisis death calculations (may lack randomness)

**Success Criteria:**
- Identify at least 3 specific deterministic formulas causing convergence
- Document exact line numbers and function names
- Verify that fixes produce Monte Carlo variance

### ⏸️ P0.5: Add Stochasticity to Crisis Mortality (BLOCKED by P0.4)
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Status:** Blocked - waiting for P0.4 investigation results

**Planned Fix:**
Add ±20-40% random variation to monthly mortality rates:
```typescript
const baseMortalityRate = 0.02 * cascadeSeverity;
const randomVariation = 0.7 + Math.random() * 0.6; // 70% to 130%
const monthlyMortalityRate = baseMortalityRate * randomVariation;
```

**Apply to:**
- Famine mortality
- Disease mortality
- Climate mortality
- Ecosystem mortality
- Conflict mortality

### ⏸️ P0.6: Add Stochasticity to Resource Dynamics (BLOCKED by P0.4)
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Status:** Blocked - waiting for P0.4 investigation results

**Planned Fix:**
Add weather/efficiency variation to resource depletion:
```typescript
const baseDepletion = population * 0.01;
const weatherVariation = 0.8 + Math.random() * 0.4; // ±20%
const efficiencyVariation = 0.9 + Math.random() * 0.2; // ±10%
const monthlyDepletion = baseDepletion * weatherVariation * efficiencyVariation;
```

**Apply to:**
- Freshwater (precipitation variation, droughts)
- Food production (crop yield variation, harvest failures)
- Materials/minerals (extraction efficiency)
- Energy (renewable intermittency, infrastructure failures)

## Updated Timeline

| Phase | Tasks | Original | Revised | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| **P0** | 3 → 6 fixes | 1 day (6-9 hours) | 2-3 days (16-24 hours) | 🟡 50% Done |
| **P1** | 5 fixes | 1 week (20-25 hours) | 1 week (20-25 hours) | ⏸️ Blocked by P0 |
| **P2** | 5 improvements | 2-4 weeks (40-60 hours) | 2-4 weeks (40-60 hours) | Not started |

**Total to Publication:** 76-109 hours (was 66-94 hours) = +10 hours for determinism investigation/fixes

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (Oct 15-18, 2025)

**Day 1 (4-6 hours): P0.4 Investigation**
1. Implement diagnostic logging in simulation engine
2. Run 3-5 Monte Carlo runs with logging enabled
3. Compare outputs line-by-line to find identical metrics
4. Document all deterministic systems found

**Day 2 (4-6 hours): P0.5-P0.6 Implementation**
1. Add stochasticity to top 3 deterministic systems identified
2. Use ±20-40% random variation as starting point
3. Run 10-run Monte Carlo to verify variance appears

**Day 3 (2-3 hours): Validation & Iteration**
1. Verify population endpoints vary by >20%
2. Verify some runs avoid cascade (not 100% convergence)
3. If still converging, increase stochasticity magnitude or investigate further

**Escalation Plan:**
If P0.6 complete and still 100% convergence:
- Review random seed implementation (verify seeds are actually different)
- Consider structural changes (not just parameter variation)
- Add debug mode logging ALL random number generation

### Questions for Planning

1. **Investigation vs. blind fixes:** Should we implement P0.5-P0.6 blindly, or wait for P0.4 investigation results?
   - **Recommendation:** Do P0.4 first - will save time by targeting actual determinism sources

2. **Known deterministic systems:** Are there other known systems beyond mortality/resources/environment?
   - **Recommendation:** Ask domain experts if they know of other deterministic calculations

3. **Debug mode:** Should we add logging of all Math.random() calls to verify randomness is being used?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, as part of P0.4 - will quickly reveal if randomness is absent

4. **Magnitude of randomness:** How much stochasticity is sufficient? ±10%? ±30%? ±50%?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with ±20-30%, can increase if convergence persists

## Success Metrics

### Current State (Post P0.1-P0.3)
- ✅ AI capability: Reaches >2.0 in 10 years (was never above 1.0)
- ✅ Organizations: Bankruptcy mechanics valid (was impossible)
- ✅ Cascade trigger: Stochastic (was deterministic)
- ❌ **Outcome variance: 0% (all runs identical) - CRITICAL BLOCKER**

### Target State (Post P0.4-P0.6)
- ✅ Outcome variance: >20% variance in population endpoints
- ✅ Population range: 0.3B to 3B across runs (not all 0.34B)
- ✅ Cascade avoidance: 10-30% of runs avoid cascade entirely
- ✅ Resource trajectories: Diverge after Month 20-30 (not lockstep)

### How to Verify Success
```bash
# Run 10-run Monte Carlo
npm run monte-carlo -- --runs 10 --months 120

# Check population variance
# - If all 10 runs show same population (±5%): FAILED - still deterministic
# - If 10 runs vary by >20%: SUCCESS - stochasticity working
# - If 10 runs vary by 5-20%: PARTIAL - needs more stochasticity

# Check outcome diversity
# - If 100% same outcome (e.g., all BOTTLENECK): FAILED
# - If 3+ different outcomes: SUCCESS
# - If 2 different outcomes: PARTIAL

# Check cascade occurrence
# - If 100% of runs have cascade: FAILED (too deterministic)
# - If 70-90% have cascade: SUCCESS (expected with current parameters)
# - If <50% have cascade: May need to recalibrate cascade probability
```
