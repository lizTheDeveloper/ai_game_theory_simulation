# P0 Progress Summary - October 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Status:** 🟢 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - 6/6 P0 tasks complete, validation pending (P0.7)

### Completed Tasks (100%)

✅ **P0.1: AI Capability Growth Rate** (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)
- Moore's Law: 2.7% → 9.05% monthly growth
- Result: 7,943x compute growth over 10 years (was 2.4x)
- Impact: AGI scenarios now properly enabled

✅ **P0.2: Organization Bankruptcy Paradox** (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)
- Fixed impossible revenue generation by bankrupt organizations
- Result: Economic conservation laws now respected

✅ **P0.3: Cascade Trigger Stochasticity** (commit 7386c4d)
- Replaced deterministic threshold with probabilistic trigger
- Result: Cascade triggered at Month 13 with 9.22% probability (was deterministic at Month 12)
- **⚠️ INSUFFICIENT:** Revealed that downstream systems remained deterministic

✅ **P0.4: Diagnostic Logging for Determinism** (commit 57598c9)
- Added comprehensive logging to 5 key systems
- Enabled comparison of Monte Carlo runs
- Result: Revealed P0.5 stochasticity was empirically unjustified

✅ **P0.5: Initial Stochasticity Implementation** (commit 2d9febd)
- Added ±10-30% monthly variation to demographics and environment
- **Research critique:** 3/10 score - confused seasonal patterns with monthly noise
- Led to P0.6 research-backed redesign
- See: [Research Validation Review](/Users/annhoward/src/superalignmenttoutopia/reviews/p0_5_stochasticity_research_validation.md)

✅ **P0.6: Research-Backed Stochasticity** (commit c251cec)
- **Birth rates:** 8% seasonal amplitude + ±2% monthly noise (CDC/PNAS data)
- **Death rates:** 12% seasonal amplitude + ±2% monthly noise (CDC mortality data)
- **Environmental mortality:** Episodic shock system (2-15% probability, 150-300% spikes)
- **AR1 autocorrelation:** Shocks persist 3-12 months (realistic temporal correlation)
- **Research basis:** 2003 European heatwave, Somalia famine 2010-12
- **Impact:** Replaces P0.5's unjustified randomness with empirically validated patterns

### Critical Discovery & Resolution

**Problem:** After P0.3, all 10 Monte Carlo runs converged to identical outcomes (0.34B population)

**Root Cause:** Demographic and environmental systems used deterministic formulas

**Solution Path:**
1. P0.4: Added diagnostic logging to identify deterministic systems
2. P0.5: First attempt at stochasticity (±10-30% monthly variation)
3. Research validation: Revealed P0.5 approach was empirically unjustified (3/10 score)
4. P0.6: Redesigned with research-backed patterns (seasonal cycles, episodic shocks, AR1 persistence)

**Status:** Implementation complete. P0.7 validation needed to verify variance restoration.

## Next Task: P0.7 Validation

### 🔴 P0.7: Validate Monte Carlo Variance (URGENT)
**Priority:** HIGH - Verify P0.6 successfully restored variance
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Status:** Not started

**Tasks:**
1. Run 10-iteration Monte Carlo analysis with P0.6 stochasticity
2. Measure population endpoint variance across runs
3. Check for outcome diversity (not all identical outcomes)
4. Inspect time series for seasonal patterns and episodic shocks
5. Document variance metrics and compare to pre-P0.6 baseline

**Success Criteria:**
- Population endpoint variance >20% across runs
- Seasonal patterns visible in birth/death time series
- Environmental shocks occur episodically (not every month)
- Some runs avoid cascade entirely (10-30% expected)

**Next Steps:**
- **If success:** Mark P0 complete, begin P1 (Research-Grade Realism)
- **If failure:** Create P0.8 to diagnose insufficient variance

## Updated Timeline

| Phase | Tasks | Original | Revised | Actual | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | 3 → 7 tasks | 1 day (6-9 hours) | 2-3 days (18-26 hours) | ~20 hours | 🟢 95% Done (P0.7 pending) |
| **P1** | 5 fixes | 1 week (20-25 hours) | 1 week (20-25 hours) | TBD | ⏸️ Awaiting P0.7 |
| **P2** | 5 improvements | 2-4 weeks (40-60 hours) | 2-4 weeks (40-60 hours) | TBD | Not started |

**P0 Breakdown:**
- P0.1-P0.3: 6-9 hours (original fixes)
- P0.4: 4 hours (diagnostic logging)
- P0.5: 3 hours (initial stochasticity)
- P0.6: 5 hours (research-backed redesign)
- P0.7: 1-2 hours (validation) - PENDING

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (Oct 15-16, 2025)

**P0.7 Validation (1-2 hours) - URGENT**
1. Run 10-iteration Monte Carlo with P0.6 stochasticity enabled
2. Measure population endpoint variance (target >20%)
3. Check for outcome diversity (not all identical)
4. Inspect time series for seasonal patterns and episodic shocks
5. Document variance metrics and compare to pre-P0.6 baseline

**If P0.7 succeeds (variance >20%):**
- Mark P0 phase complete ✅
- Update roadmap status to "P1 IN PROGRESS"
- Begin P1.1 (Debug Death Accounting) or P1.2 (Reduce Cascade Mortality)
- Celebrate research-backed stochasticity success!

**If P0.7 fails (variance <10%):**
- Create P0.8 task to diagnose insufficient variance
- Check if seasonal patterns and shocks are actually being applied in the code
- Consider additional variance sources (economic volatility, resource extraction efficiency, cascading failure mechanics)
- Review random seed implementation to verify true randomness

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Research validation is critical:** P0.5's 3/10 score saved weeks of pursuing wrong approach
2. **Seasonal ≠ monthly:** Real demographic systems have annual cycles, not monthly randomness
3. **Episodic ≠ continuous:** Environmental shocks are rare events, not constant variation
4. **Temporal correlation matters:** AR1 persistence (shocks lasting 3-12 months) is essential for realism

## Success Metrics

### Current State (Post P0.1-P0.3)
- ✅ AI capability: Reaches >2.0 in 10 years (was never above 1.0)
- ✅ Organizations: Bankruptcy mechanics valid (was impossible)
- ✅ Cascade trigger: Stochastic (was deterministic)
- ❌ **Outcome variance: 0% (all runs identical) - CRITICAL BLOCKER**

### Target State (Post P0.4-P0.6)
- ✅ Outcome variance: >20% variance in population endpoints
- ✅ Population range: 0.3B to 3B across runs (not all 0.34B)
- ✅ Cascade avoidance: 10-30% of runs avoid cascade entirely
- ✅ Resource trajectories: Diverge after Month 20-30 (not lockstep)

### How to Verify Success
```bash
# Run 10-run Monte Carlo
npm run monte-carlo -- --runs 10 --months 120

# Check population variance
# - If all 10 runs show same population (±5%): FAILED - still deterministic
# - If 10 runs vary by >20%: SUCCESS - stochasticity working
# - If 10 runs vary by 5-20%: PARTIAL - needs more stochasticity

# Check outcome diversity
# - If 100% same outcome (e.g., all BOTTLENECK): FAILED
# - If 3+ different outcomes: SUCCESS
# - If 2 different outcomes: PARTIAL

# Check cascade occurrence
# - If 100% of runs have cascade: FAILED (too deterministic)
# - If 70-90% have cascade: SUCCESS (expected with current parameters)
# - If <50% have cascade: May need to recalibrate cascade probability
```

## Next Review

**When:** After P0.4-P0.6 completion (Oct 17-18, 2025)
**What:**
- Verify Monte Carlo variance >20%
- Update roadmap with P1 next steps
- Decide if P1 can proceed or if more P0 work needed

**Review Triggers:**
- After P0.4: If investigation reveals >5 deterministic systems, may need more time
- After P0.6: If still 100% convergence, escalate for structural review
- Before P1: Confirm Monte Carlo validity before proceeding
