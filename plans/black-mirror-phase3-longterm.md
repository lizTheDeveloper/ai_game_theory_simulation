# Black Mirror Phase 3: Long-Term Research (6-12 months)

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 6-12 months (ongoing research)
**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Research-Dependent Systems

## Overview

Phase 3 includes items that require substantial research before integration, either from external studies, significant architectural changes, or resolution of fundamental measurement challenges.

**Approval:** Research-dependent. Requires external validation before implementation.

## Systems for Future Consideration

### 1. Digital Consciousness Governance Preparedness (Ongoing)

**Status:** NOT modeling consciousness itself, but governance readiness

**What This Would Include:**
- Scenario planning framework ("What if digital consciousness emerges?")
- Binary uncertainty modeling (Possible vs Not Possible)
- Ethical framework preparedness metrics
- Rights recognition lag (historical data: 50-100 years)
- Precautionary response strength

**Research Needed:**
- Historical rights movement timelines
- Expert consensus on consciousness detection approaches
- Governance framework proposals from EA/alignment community
- Precautionary principle application studies

**Why Long-Term:**
- Consciousness detection remains unsolved philosophically
- Governance frameworks still in early development
- Requires collaboration with external researchers

**Timeline:** Ongoing research collaboration, 6-12+ months

### 2. Advanced Performative Behavior Modeling (12+ months)

**Current Problem:** "Authenticity" is philosophically incoherent as single metric

**What Could Be Modeled Instead:**
- Self-presentation effort (time spent curating digital presence)
- Cognitive burden of maintaining image
- Social media performance metrics (posting frequency, curation intensity)
- Psychological impacts (burnout, identity fragmentation, well-being effects)

**Research Needed:**
- Longitudinal studies on self-presentation effort
- Psychological impact assessments
- Cross-cultural validation (Western bias concerns)
- Operational definitions avoiding philosophical problems

**Why Long-Term:**
- Requires reconceptualization from "authenticity" to measurable proxies
- New empirical studies needed
- Cross-cultural validation essential

**Timeline:** External research required, 12+ months

### 3. Autonomous Weapon Degradation Curves (6-9 months)

**Note:** NOT perpetual autonomous weapons (rejected by both agents)

**What Could Be Modeled:**
- Operational degradation over time (mechanical failures, energy depletion)
- Maintenance requirements and logistics
- Human-in-the-loop decision points
- International treaty constraints
- Escalation/de-escalation dynamics

**Research Needed:**
- Military logistics research (non-classified)
- Reliability engineering for autonomous systems
- International law expert input
- Failure mode analysis

**Why Long-Term:**
- Sensitive topic requiring careful framing
- Need non-classified military logistics data
- Must avoid "killer robot" science fiction tropes

**Timeline:** 6-9 months with expert consultation

## Key Principles for Phase 3

**Research-First Approach:**
- Do NOT implement until research validates mechanisms
- Collaborate with external domain experts
- Prefer operational definitions over philosophical abstractions
- Cross-cultural validation essential

**Measurement Challenges:**
- Avoid unmeasurable abstractions (consciousness, authenticity as global metrics)
- Use measurable proxies when core concept is philosophical
- Document limitations transparently

**External Dependencies:**
- Phase 3 timelines depend on external research community
- May require commissioning new studies
- Timeline estimates are optimistic best-case scenarios

## Decision Gates

Each Phase 3 item requires:
- [ ] Published peer-reviewed research supporting mechanism
- [ ] Operational definitions that avoid philosophical problems
- [ ] Cross-cultural validation (not just Western samples)
- [ ] Expert review from relevant domain (philosophy, military, psychology)
- [ ] Measurement approach with <20% uncertainty

**If Gates Not Met:** Move to "Deferred Research" category, revisit annually

## Relationship to Other Phases

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 3 items can be explored independently of Phase 1-2
- No blocking dependencies

**Integration:**
- If research matures faster than expected, promote to Phase 2
- If fundamental barriers discovered, move to "Rejected" with documentation
