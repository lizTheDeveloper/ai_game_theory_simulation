## Implementation Notes

### Priority Considerations
- **Phases 1-3** are absolutely essential - the game cannot function without them
- **Phases 4-5** add the critical complexity that makes the simulation interesting
- **Phase 6** is essential for balanced outcomes (not just dystopia/extinction)
- **Phases 7-8** add depth but could be partially deferred if needed
- **Phases 9-10** are necessary for a polished, usable product

### Technical Architecture Recommendations
1. Use event-driven architecture for agent actions and state changes
2. Implement state as immutable snapshots for easy history/replay
3. Use composition over inheritance for agent capabilities
4. Create clear interfaces between systems for modularity
5. Build with multiplayer capability in mind from the start

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit test each dynamics function independently
2. Integration test each phase before moving to the next
3. Create automated scenario runners for balance testing
4. Use property-based testing for emergence verification
5. Implement deterministic mode for reproducible testing

This plan provides a clear implementation path from basic foundation to fully-featured simulation, with each phase building on the previous while maintaining functional completeness at each stage.
