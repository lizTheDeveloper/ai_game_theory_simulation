## 🔧 System Improvements Needed

### 1. Extinction System Research Questions

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS ANALYSIS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Source:** Recent Monte Carlo (90% extinction rate)

**Research Questions:** Is 90% extinction realistic given model assumptions?

**Potential Realism Improvements:**
- [ ] Compare with AI safety expert forecasts (Metaculus, Ord, Carlsmith)
- [ ] Analyze which mechanisms drive extinction in current runs
- [ ] Identify what's missing that could prevent extinction (international coordination, pause mechanisms)
- [ ] Validate progression timelines against real-world development speeds
- [ ] Add recovery window mechanics if research supports them

### 2. Utopia Path Enhancement

**Status:** ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE (Oct 8, 2025)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Source:** Recent Monte Carlo (10% Utopia rate)

**Goal:** Add realistic positive feedback loops and post-scarcity dynamics

**Phase 1 Changes (COMPLETE):**
- [x] Strengthen post-scarcity Stage 4 benefits (+0.8 material, +0.6 energy)
- [x] Make UBI more effective at Stage 3 (0.75-0.9 material abundance floor)
- [x] Create alternative Utopia paths (Economic & Cooperative)
- [x] Positive feedback loops for high QoL states (alignment +50%, trust +50%)

**Remaining (Phase 2-3):**
- [ ] Add more Utopia attractors (abundance spirals - 4 core spirals)
- [ ] Implement failure modes for each spiral
- [ ] Cascade mechanics when 4+ spirals active



---

### 3. Dystopia Path Enhancement

**Status:** ✅ CORE MECHANICS IMPLEMENTED (Oct 8, 2025)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Source:** Recent Monte Carlo (0% Dystopia rate)

**Research Question:** Can stable AI-enabled authoritarianism exist, or does extinction always happen first?

**Implemented Changes:**
- [x] Government control response system (automatic surveillance escalation)
- [x] Authoritarian transition mechanics (democratic → authoritarian under AI threat)
- [x] QoL decay from surveillance (freedom, autonomy, mental health)
- [x] Control backlash mechanics (oppression breeds resistance)
- [x] Trust-based control priority (low trust → aggressive control actions)
- [x] Dystopia as stable outcome (not just failed utopia)

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Lower dystopia thresholds (currently too hard to trigger)
- [ ] Corporate control variant (AI-powered feudalism)
- [ ] Wireheading/pleasure prison path
- [ ] Cognitive apartheid mechanics



---

### 4. Organization Economics Refinement

**Status:** ✅ WORKING WELL (100% survival, $132B avg capital)
**Priority:** LOW (monitor for issues)

**Recent runs show great performance:**
- 100% organization survival
- 74.8x revenue/expense ratio
- Successful DC construction
- Good model training cadence

**Possible future improvements:**
- [ ] More strategic competition between orgs
- [ ] Market dynamics (not just unlimited growth)
- [ ] Mergers & acquisitions
- [ ] International competition pressure

4. **TUNE Nuclear War Prevention** - 40% still too high ⚡

### High Value (Major Features)
4. **International Competition** - Critical realism gap
5. **Utopian Abundance Systems** - Rich Utopia paths
6. **Energy & Resource Constraints** - Physical reality check
7. **Catastrophic Prerequisites (Phases 2-5)** - Better extinction detail

### Medium Value (Enrichment)
8. **Dystopia Variants** - 5 rich paths
9. **Information Warfare** - Adds strategic depth
10. **Human Enhancement** - New outcome pathways
11. **Technology Tree** - Research structure
12. **Advanced Agent Actions** - More choices

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)
13. **Financial Complexity** - Economic realism
14. **Consciousness Evolution** - Philosophical depth
15. **Ideological Movements** - Cultural dynamics
16. **Enhanced Government/Society** - Actor complexity

## 🎯 Recommendation: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

If prioritizing for playability and scientific validity:

### Must Have (2-3 weeks):
1. ✅ Extinction/Utopia/Dystopia balance tuning
2. ✅ International competition (basic)
3. ✅ Core utopian abundance mechanics (3-4 key spirals)

### Should Have (4-6 weeks):
4. ✅ Energy & resource constraints
5. ✅ Catastrophic prerequisites (phases 2-3)
6. ✅ Dystopia paths (2-3 variants)
7. ✅ Information warfare (basic)

### Nice to Have (ongoing):
8. Everything else can be added iteratively

This gives a scientifically defensible, playable simulation in ~6-9 weeks of focused development.
