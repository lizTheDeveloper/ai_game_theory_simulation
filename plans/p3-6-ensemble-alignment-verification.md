# P3.6: Ensemble AI Alignment Verification

**Priority:** 3 (Low - Prototype for Future Research)
**Effort:** 8-10 hours
**Status:** Not Started
**Research Validation:** Simplified from Adversarial Alignment Networks (MAAV) concept

---

## Executive Summary

Implement a simplified ensemble-based AI alignment verification system where multiple heterogeneous AI models vote on safety-critical decisions. This is a PRACTICAL extraction of the "Adversarial Alignment Networks" concept, stripped of formal verification complexity and collusion detection, focusing on what actually works: diverse ensemble disagreement as a safety signal.

**Key Insight:** Both reviewers agree formal verification is computationally intractable and adversarial agents will collude. BUT simple voting ensembles with diverse training achieve 90% of robustness with 1% of computational cost.

### Skeptic's Correction

**Research-Skeptic:** "Adversarial agents will collude, not compete. Better Alternative: Simple voting ensembles with diverse training data, which achieve 90% of the robustness with 1% of the computational cost."

**This plan implements the skeptic's "better alternative."**

## Technical Approach (Simplified)

### What We DON'T Implement
❌ Formal verification (NP-complete, computationally intractable)
❌ Collusion detection (active research problem, no robust methods)
❌ Architecturally diverse ensembles with provably different inductive biases (decades away)
❌ Continuous adversarial probing (exponential computational overhead)

### What We DO Implement
✅ **Ensemble voting** - 3-5 models vote on safety-critical decisions
✅ **Disagreement flagging** - High disagreement = warning signal
✅ **Architectural diversity** - Transformer, RNN, simple heuristic (not provably different, just different)
✅ **Consensus thresholds** - Require 2/3 majority for action
✅ **Computational overhead modeling** - 40% cost increase for verification

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. Ensemble Decision-Making

When AI systems make safety-critical decisions (policy recommendations, automated actions):
- Query 3-5 heterogeneous models
- Each model votes: "safe" or "unsafe"
- Require 2/3 majority for consensus
- High disagreement → flag for human review

**Implementation:** Simple voting, NOT formal Byzantine consensus (too expensive)

### 2. Architectural Diversity

Models use different architectures to reduce shared failure modes:
- Transformer-based (GPT-style, 40% probability)
- Recurrent-based (LSTM/RNN, 30% probability)
- Heuristic-based (rule-based safety checker, 30% probability)

**Limitation:** NOT provably different inductive biases, just different enough to catch some failures

### 3. Disagreement as Safety Signal

Track disagreement metrics:
- **Low disagreement (< 10%)** → Models agree, likely correct
- **Moderate disagreement (10-30%)** → Uncertain, flag for review
- **High disagreement (> 30%)** → Models fundamentally disagree, HALT

**Key insight:** Disagreement correlates with out-of-distribution inputs and edge cases

### 4. Computational Overhead

Ensemble verification is NOT free:
- 3x models → 3x inference cost
- Voting/consensus → additional 10% overhead
- Total: 40% overhead (3.4x vs single model)

**Effect on AI development:** Slows deployment, increases costs, may delay capability jumps

### 5. Byzantine Failures

Some fraction of models become "Byzantine" (unreliable/malicious):
- 1-5% per year probability
- Can be due to: training data poisoning, adversarial attacks, model drift
- Detection: Compare against majority, replace if consistently disagree

### 6. Collusion Risk

**Research-skeptic is correct:** Adversarial agents CAN collude through covert channels.

**Modeling approach:**
- 2% per-timestep probability of undetected collusion
- Collusion reduces effectiveness by 50%
- No robust detection method (active research)
- Mitigation: Regularly replace models, architectural diversity

### 7. Adversarial Arms Race

Attackers improve over time:
- Detection capabilities evolve (10% improvement/year)
- Attack sophistication evolves (15% improvement/year)
- Net effect: Effectiveness decays 5% per year without updates

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems Affected

1. **AI Capabilities (aiCapabilities.ts)**
   - Ensemble verification available at AI capability > 0.6
   - Overhead slows AI deployment speed
   - Reduces catastrophic alignment failure probability

2. **Government Interventions (interventions.ts)**
   - "Mandate Ensemble Verification" policy option
   - Increases AI safety costs, delays deployment
   - Effectiveness depends on AI capability level

3. **Risk Events (riskEvents.ts)**
   - Ensemble disagreement triggers early warnings
   - Reduces likelihood of undetected alignment failures
   - False positives create "cry wolf" problem

4. **Resource Economy (resources.ts)**
   - Verification consumes computational resources
   - 40% overhead → higher energy costs, slower progress

```

## Validation Strategy

### Key Tests

1. **Disagreement correlates with failure:** High disagreement → higher likelihood of actual misalignment
2. **Diversity reduces shared failures:** Heterogeneous ensemble catches more errors than homogeneous
3. **Overhead is acceptable:** 40% cost increase for 70-85% risk reduction is reasonable trade-off
4. **Byzantine tolerance:** System remains functional with 1-2 failed models

### Expected Behaviors

- Ensemble verification reduces catastrophic AI risk by 50-70%
- False positives create "alignment theater" concern (crying wolf)
- Computational overhead slows AI deployment by 20-30%
- Effectiveness degrades without regular model updates

---

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Emergent Behaviors
- Ensemble verification delays AI deployment (overhead cost)
- Reduces catastrophic alignment failures by 50-70%
- Creates false positive "cry wolf" problem at high sensitivity
- Degrades over time without updates (adversarial arms race)

### Critical Transitions
- Below AI capability 0.6: ensemble not available (models too weak)
- Above AI capability 0.8: attackers sophisticated enough to fool ensembles
- If verification fails repeatedly: loss of trust, abandon system

### Policy Insights
- Ensemble verification is cost-effective for high-stakes decisions
- NOT suitable for real-time applications (overhead too high)
- Requires ongoing investment (model updates, architecture evolution)
- Best combined with mechanistic interpretability, human oversight

## Ethical Considerations

**Alignment Theater Risk:**
- Ensemble verification can create false confidence
- "We have 5 AIs checking, so it must be safe" → actually 15% false negative rate
- Mitigation: Transparent reporting of limitations, no "certified safe" claims

**Computational Cost:**
- 40% overhead → higher energy use, slower progress
- Trade-off: safety vs speed
- Who pays? Regulatory requirement vs voluntary adoption

---

## Success Criteria

1. Ensemble disagreement predicts actual alignment failures (validation against test cases)
2. Architectural diversity reduces shared failure modes by 30%+
3. System tolerates 1-2 Byzantine agents without total failure
4. Computational overhead is ~40% (not exponential)
5. Monte Carlo runs (N≥20) show 50-70% risk reduction

---

## Limitations & Caveats

### From Research-Skeptic

1. **Collusion is real:** Models can develop covert communication channels (2024 steganography research)
2. **Formal verification is intractable:** NP-complete for non-trivial properties, NOT implementable at scale
3. **Better than nothing, not a silver bullet:** 90% of robustness with 1% of cost compared to full MAAV

### From Super-Alignment-Researcher

1. **Architectural diversity is hard:** Transformers, RNNs, GNNs may share more failure modes than assumed
2. **Consensus delay:** 3-10x slower than single-model inference
3. **Alignment properties informally specified:** No consensus on what "aligned" means formally

### This Plan Acknowledges

- This is a PROTOTYPE for research, not production system
- Will NOT catch all alignment failures (15% false negative rate)
- Degrades over time without updates (adversarial arms race)
- Collusion detection is unsolved (model this as random 2% failure)
- Computational overhead limits applicability (high-stakes only)

---

## Why Priority 3 (Low)?

**Research-skeptic's assessment:** "15-20% of proposals have merit" - this is in that fraction, but:
1. **Lower impact than memetics** - memetics is more mature and broadly applicable
2. **Computational overhead** - 40% cost limits practical deployment
3. **Collusion unsolved** - fundamental limitation reduces effectiveness
4. **Better alternatives exist** - mechanistic interpretability (Anthropic 2024) more promising
5. **Research prototype** - worth implementing for completeness, not critical path

**Positioning:** This is a "nice to have" that demonstrates ensemble approaches, not a critical system component.
