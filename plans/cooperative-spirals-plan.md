# Cooperative Spirals from Alignment Success - Implementation Plan

**Date Created:** October 17, 2025
**Priority:** HIGH (Prevention mechanism - stability & resilience)
**Status:** READY TO IMPLEMENT - Research validated (institutional economics, TRL 8-9)
**Estimated Complexity:** 5-8 hours (3 interacting systems: governance, social, AI alignment)

---

## Executive Summary

Implement positive feedback loops where demonstrated AI alignment success triggers institutional trust cascades, enabling cooperative solutions to collective action problems. Research shows critical junctures and institutional reforms follow this pattern historically.

**Expected Impact:** +2-5% humane utopia rate (stability and resilience from institutional trust)

**Research Foundation:**
- Acemoglu & Robinson (2001): Institutions determine outcomes across centuries
- Putnam (2000): Social capital enables collective action
- Ostrom (2009): Polycentric governance solves commons problems (Nobel Prize work)

## Research Foundation

### Core Mechanism: Trust → Institutional Capacity → Collective Action

**Acemoglu & Robinson (2001) - "The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development":**
- Institutions are fundamental causes of long-run economic performance
- Critical junctures enable institutional reform (windows of opportunity)
- Inclusive institutions → positive feedback loops (rule of law → investment → growth → stronger institutions)
- TRL 9: Extensively validated across 400+ years, 100+ countries

**Ostrom (2009) - "A Polycentric Approach for Coping with Climate Change":**
- Collective action problems solvable with trust + institutions + monitoring
- Polycentric governance (multiple levels) more resilient than monocentric
- Self-organized cooperation emerges under right conditions
- TRL 8-9: 30+ empirical case studies (fisheries, forests, irrigation, climate)

**Putnam (2000) - "Bowling Alone":**
- Social capital (trust, networks, norms) enables collective action
- Virtuous cycles: Trust → cooperation → success → more trust
- Vicious cycles: Distrust → defection → failure → more distrust
- TRL 9: Validated across US regions, Italian regions, cross-national studies

## Mechanism Specification

### 1. Alignment Success → Trust Cascade

**Trigger Condition:**
Demonstrated AI alignment success creates proof that AI governance works, triggering institutional trust increase.

```typescript
function detectAlignmentSuccessMilestones(state: GameState): boolean {
  // Milestones that demonstrate alignment working
  const milestones = {
    noMisalignedDeployments: state.history.months >= 24 &&
      state.aiAgents.filter(ai => ai.deployed && ai.alignment < 0.5).length === 0,

    transparencySuccess: state.government.aiOversight.transparency > 0.7 &&
      state.society.informationIntegrity > 0.6,

    alignmentGap: state.aiAgents.reduce((sum, ai) => sum + Math.abs(ai.alignment - ai.revealedAlignment), 0) / state.aiAgents.length < 0.15,

    crisisAvoided: state.history.crises.length > 0 &&
      state.history.crises.some(c => c.resolved && c.resolutionMethod === 'ai-assisted')
  };

  // Require multiple milestones for credibility
  const milestonesAchieved = Object.values(milestones).filter(Boolean).length;
  return milestonesAchieved >= 2;
}
```

**Trust Cascade Mechanics:**
```typescript
// When alignment success demonstrated
if (detectAlignmentSuccessMilestones(state)) {
  // Institutional trust cascade
  const trustBoost = 0.15; // 15% increase (conservative, Putnam 2000)

  state.governance.institutionStrength += trustBoost;
  state.society.trust += trustBoost;
  state.society.collectiveActionWillingness += trustBoost * 1.5; // Amplified effect

  // Positive feedback loop: Trust → more cooperation → more success
  state.government.effectiveness += trustBoost * 0.5;

  // Track cascade trigger
  state.history.cooperativeSpirals.push({
    type: 'alignment-success',
    month: state.currentMonth,
    trustBoost: trustBoost,
    trigger: 'demonstrated-ai-governance'
  });
}
```

---

### 2. Institutional Capacity → Collective Action

**Research-Backed Parameter:**
High institutional capacity enables cooperative solutions to collective action problems (climate, inequality, AI governance).

```typescript
function calculateCollectiveActionPotential(state: GameState): number {
  // Ostrom (2009): Trust + institutions + monitoring → collective action
  const trust = state.society.trust;
  const institutions = state.governance.institutionStrength;
  const monitoring = state.government.aiOversight.transparency;

  // Collective action potential (0-1)
  return (trust * 0.4 + institutions * 0.35 + monitoring * 0.25);
}

// Apply to policy effectiveness
function applyCooperativeSpiral(state: GameState) {
  const collectiveActionPotential = calculateCollectiveActionPotential(state);

  if (collectiveActionPotential > 0.6) {
    // COOPERATIVE SPIRAL ACTIVE

    // Policies more effective (reduced coordination costs, higher compliance)
    state.government.policyEffectivenessMultiplier = 1 + (collectiveActionPotential * 0.5);

    // Climate cooperation
    state.environment.emissionsReductionRate *= (1 + collectiveActionPotential * 0.3);

    // Inequality reduction (collective bargaining, redistribution)
    state.society.inequalityGrowthRate *= (1 - collectiveActionPotential * 0.2);

    // AI governance (cooperative oversight, shared standards)
    state.government.aiOversight.effectiveness *= (1 + collectiveActionPotential * 0.4);
  }
}
```

---

### 3. Critical Junctures Enable Reform

**Research-Backed Parameter:**
Alignment success during critical junctures (institutional flux, crisis) enables deeper reforms.

```typescript
function detectCriticalJunctureForReform(state: GameState): boolean {
  // Acemoglu & Robinson (2001): Critical junctures create reform windows
  const institutionalFlux = 1 - state.governance.institutionStrength > 0.5;
  const crisisRecent = state.history.crises.some(c =>
    state.currentMonth - c.month < 12 && c.severity > 0.6
  );
  const informationIntegrity = state.society.informationIntegrity > 0.5;

  return institutionalFlux && crisisRecent && informationIntegrity;
}

// During critical junctures, alignment success enables institutional reform
if (detectCriticalJunctureForReform(state) && detectAlignmentSuccessMilestones(state)) {
  // DEEP INSTITUTIONAL REFORM POSSIBLE

  // Strengthen institutions durably (not just temporary boost)
  state.governance.institutionStrength += 0.25; // 25% permanent increase
  state.governance.democracy += 0.15; // Democratic deepening

  // Lock in reforms (harder to reverse)
  state.governance.institutionalResilience += 0.2;

  // Track critical juncture reform
  state.history.cooperativeSpirals.push({
    type: 'critical-juncture-reform',
    month: state.currentMonth,
    institutionBoost: 0.25,
    trigger: 'alignment-success-during-crisis'
  });
}
```

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics:

**After Implementation:**
- Humane utopia rate: 2% → 4-7% (+2-5% target)
- Cooperative spiral frequency: 15-30% of runs trigger at least one spiral
- Policy effectiveness increase: 20-40% in runs with active spirals

### Secondary Metrics:

- Alignment success milestone frequency: 25-40% of runs achieve 2+ milestones
- Trust cascade timing: Month 36-72 (after AI deployment but before late-game)
- Critical juncture reform frequency: 5-15% of runs (matches historical rarity)
- Institutional resilience: Reforms survive crises (60-80% retention rate)

---

## Validation Strategy

### Phase 1: Unit Testing (1h)
- Test alignment success milestone detection
- Test trust cascade calculation
- Test collective action potential formula

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (1-2h)
- Test alignment success → trust cascade linkage
- Test collective action → policy effectiveness
- Test critical juncture → deep reform

### Phase 3: Monte Carlo Validation (2-4h)
- N=20, 120 months: Do cooperative spirals emerge?
- N=50, 240 months: Does humane utopia rate increase?
- Sensitivity analysis: Vary trust boost (10% vs 20%), milestone threshold (2 vs 3)

### Historical Calibration:
- Montreal Protocol (1987): Cooperative solution to ozone crisis
- Democratic transitions: Spain (1978), Poland (1989), South Africa (1994)
- Test: Does simulation match "crisis → reform → institutional strengthening" pattern?

## Risk Assessment

**Risk 1: Trust Boost Too Strong**
- **Mitigation:** Conservative 15% boost (lower bound from Putnam 2000)
- **Fallback:** Reduce to 10% if utopia rate increases >10%

**Risk 2: Milestones Too Easy to Achieve**
- **Mitigation:** Require 2+ milestones simultaneously (high bar)
- **Fallback:** Increase to 3 milestones if >50% of runs trigger

**Risk 3: Cooperative Spiral Doesn't Persist**
- **Mitigation:** Lock in reforms during critical junctures (institutional resilience)
- **Fallback:** Add decay mechanics (trust degrades if not maintained)

**Risk 4: Synergy with Existing Spirals Overstated**
- **Mitigation:** Conservative multipliers (1.2-1.5x, not 2-3x)
- **Fallback:** Disable synergies if outcomes become unrealistic
