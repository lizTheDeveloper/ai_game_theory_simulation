**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025 (P1 archived, plan cleaned up)
**Based on:** Architecture Review, Research Validation, Critical Research Review, Extinction Mechanics Audit
**Status:** üü¢ **PRIORITY 1 COMPLETE** - P0 in progress by another agent, P1 archived

**Progress Summary:**
- ‚úÖ **P1 (HIGH)**: 5/5 fixes complete (6.5 hours) - **ARCHIVED** to plans/archived/P1-COMPLETED-20251015.md
- üîÑ **P0 (CRITICAL)**: In progress by another agent (3 tasks: AI growth, bankruptcy, cascades)
- ‚è≥ **P2 (MEDIUM)**: Pending P0 completion (5 tasks: calibration, innovation, heterogeneity, etc.)
- ‚è≥ **P3 (LOW)**: Not started (5 tasks: variable timesteps, unknown unknowns, etc.)

## Executive Summary

This plan consolidates findings from 4 independent critical reviews:
1. **Architecture Review** (38K) - Found 5 bugs, 3 architectural issues, 4 parameter critiques
2. **Research Validation Review** (52K) - Compared results to peer-reviewed research across 7 subsystems
3. **Critical Research Review** (10K) - Identified AI capability growth off by 400x, alignment overconfidence
4. **Extinction Mechanics Audit** (devlog) - Documented false extinction bug, organizations never die

**Consensus Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **Excellent:** Planetary boundaries framework, deceptive alignment mechanics, multi-dimensional modeling
- ‚ùå **Critical:** AI capability growth 100-400x too slow, environmental degradation 100-1000x too fast
- ‚ùå **Blocking:** Deterministic outcomes (100% of runs converge), zero recovery mechanics, false extinction reporting

**Outcome:** Current results **NOT CREDIBLE** for publication, but simulation framework is fundamentally sound.

**Timeline to Credibility:**
- **P0 Fixes (2-3 days):** Restore basic validity and Monte Carlo variance
- **P1 Fixes (1 week):** Achieve realism
- **P2 Improvements (2-4 weeks):** Full research-grade quality

**P0 Progress (Oct 15, 2025):**
- ‚úÖ P0.1-P0.3: COMPLETED (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)
- üî¥ CRITICAL DISCOVERY: P0.3 fixed cascade trigger stochasticity, but **all 10 Monte Carlo runs still converge to identical 0.34B population**
- üî¥ NEW PRIORITY: P0.4-P0.6 added to investigate remaining determinism sources (mortality, resources, environment)

---

## Priority 0: CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Any Further Analysis

**Goal:** Restore basic simulation validity and Monte Carlo variance
**Timeline:** 2-3 days (16-24 hours total)
**Outcome:** Results become directionally credible with varied Monte Carlo outcomes

**Progress Update (Oct 15, 2025):**
- ‚úÖ P0.1-P0.3 completed in commits 7386c4d, ae667c3
- ‚ö†Ô∏è P0.3 partially successful: Cascade trigger now stochastic, BUT outcomes still converge
- üî¥ P0.4-P0.6 added: Investigation and fixes for remaining determinism sources

### P0.1: Fix AI Capability Growth Rate (2-4 hours) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Invalidates all AI timeline conclusions
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)

**Problem:**
- Current: 3%/month Moore's Law = 2.4x per decade
- Empirical: Epoch AI documents 100-1000x per decade (doubling every 6-10 months)
- Impact: AGI never reached in simulations, all transformative AI scenarios disabled

**Evidence:**
- Oct 15 log: Max AI capability 0.819 after 60 months (never reached 1.0)
- Oct 14 log: Max capability 1.300 after 240 months (barely above human-level after 20 years)
- Research: GPT-2 (2019) ‚Üí GPT-4 (2023) = 1,000x parameters, 100,000x compute in 4 years

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// File: src/simulation/computeInfrastructure.ts
// Moore's Law rate increased from 2.7% to 9.05% per month
const MONTHLY_GROWTH_RATE = Math.pow(2, 1/8); // 9.05% = doubles every 8 months

// File: src/simulation/research.ts
// Added recursive self-improvement acceleration
if (ai.capability > 2.0) {
  const recursiveFactor = Math.min(ai.capability * 0.05, 0.20);
  ai.capability *= (1 + recursiveFactor);
}
```

**Results:**
- Compute growth: 7,943x over 10 years (was 2.4x)
- AI capability: Now reaches transformative levels in realistic timeframes
- AGI scenarios: Now properly enabled in simulation runs

**Test Criteria:**
- [x] At least 20% of runs reach AI capability > 2.0 by Month 120 (10 years)
- [x] At least 5% of runs reach AI capability > 5.0 by Month 240 (20 years)
- [x] AGI-related catastrophic scenarios (takeover, escape) now trigger in some runs

### P0.2: Fix Organization Bankruptcy Paradox (1 hour) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Physically impossible economics
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (commits 7386c4d, ae667c3)

**Problem:**
- Oct 15 log: "100% organizations bankrupt" BUT Oct 14 log: "Avg Capital: $122.8B"
- Organizations simultaneously bankrupt AND accumulating massive capital
- Violates conservation laws (can't make money while bankrupt)

**Evidence:**
```
ORGANIZATION SURVIVAL:
  Avg Survival Rate: 0.0%
  Avg Capital Accumulation: $122.8B
  ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Impossible!
```

**Root Cause:**
- Bankruptcy mechanics added Oct 13, 2025
- Revenue calculation runs before bankruptcy check
- Bankrupt flag set, but revenue/capital still accumulating

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// File: src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts
// Added bankruptcy guard to revenue calculation
function calculateOrganizationRevenue(org: Organization, state: GameState): number {
  if (org.bankrupt) {
    org.monthlyRevenue = 0;
    org.capital = Math.max(0, org.capital - org.operationalCosts);
    return 0;
  }
  // ... existing revenue logic
}

// Fixed aggregation in Monte Carlo reporting
if (org.bankrupt) {
  org.capital = 0;
  org.monthlyRevenue = 0;
}
```

**Results:**
- Bankrupt organizations now correctly show $0 capital and revenue
- Compute growth halts when organizations fail (no impossible investment)
- Economic conservation laws now respected

**Test Criteria:**
- [x] Bankrupt organizations show $0 capital in final reports
- [x] Bankrupt organizations show $0 revenue
- [x] If 100% bankruptcy, compute growth should halt (no new data centers)

### P0.3: Fix Deterministic Cascade Triggers (3-4 hours) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Invalidates Monte Carlo variance
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (commit 7386c4d) - ‚ö†Ô∏è **INSUFFICIENT** (see P0.4 below)

**Problem:**
- Oct 14: ALL 10 runs reached IDENTICAL population (0.34B, exactly 95.7% decline)
- Cascade triggers deterministically at risk > 50%, no randomness
- Monte Carlo is meaningless if all seeds produce same outcome

**Evidence:**
```
Oct 14 (10 runs): 100% bottleneck, 95.7% avg decline (EXACT to 0.1%)
Oct 15 (2 runs): 100% inconclusive, 85.7% avg decline
```

Statistical impossibility with random seeds unless system is deterministic.

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// File: /src/simulation/planetaryBoundaries.ts:454-456
if (system.tippingPointRisk > 0.5) {
  system.cascadeSeverity = Math.pow((system.tippingPointRisk - 0.5) / 0.5, 1.5);
  system.cascadeMultiplier = 1.0 + system.cascadeSeverity;
}
```

**Problem:** No stochasticity! Risk > 50% = guaranteed cascade.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// File: src/simulation/planetaryBoundaries.ts
// Stochastic trigger with quadratic probability curve
if (system.tippingPointRisk > 0.5) {
  const cascadeProbability = Math.pow((system.tippingPointRisk - 0.5) / 0.5, 2.0);
  const monthlyTriggerChance = cascadeProbability * 0.10; // 0-10% monthly chance

  if (!system.cascadeActive && Math.random() < monthlyTriggerChance) {
    system.cascadeActive = true;
    system.cascadeStartMonth = state.currentMonth;
    console.log(`üå™Ô∏è TIPPING POINT CASCADE TRIGGERED (Risk: ${(system.tippingPointRisk * 100).toFixed(1)}%)`);
  }
}
```

**Verification:**
- Cascade triggered at Month 13 with 9.22% probability (not deterministic at Month 12)
- Stochastic trigger mechanism working correctly
- **However: 10-run Monte Carlo still converged to IDENTICAL outcome (0.34B population, all runs)**

**Critical Discovery:**
P0.3 fixed ONE source of determinism (cascade trigger), but **other deterministic mechanics are overwhelming the randomness**. The simulation still cannot produce varied Monte Carlo outcomes. See P0.4 below for investigation.

**Test Criteria:**
- [x] Cascade trigger is stochastic (not deterministic threshold)
- [x] Trigger timing varies across runs (verified: Month 13 vs previous Month 12)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **FAILED:** 100-run Monte Carlo shows outcome variance (still 100% convergence)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **FAILED:** Population endpoints vary by >20% across runs (still IDENTICAL)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **FAILED:** Some runs avoid cascade entirely (all 10 runs had cascade)

- architecture-review-20251015.md lines 133-189 (BUG #3)
- research-validation-20251015.md lines 104-194

### P0.4: Investigate Remaining Sources of Determinism (4-6 hours)
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Blocks Monte Carlo validity
**Status:** üî¥ **URGENT** - Highest priority after P0.3 completion

**Problem:**
Despite P0.3 successfully implementing stochastic cascade triggers, **all 10 Monte Carlo runs still converge to IDENTICAL outcomes:**
```
Run 1-10: BOTTLENECK ‚Üí 0.34B population (95.7% decline) - EXACTLY IDENTICAL
```

This is statistically impossible with different random seeds unless the simulation has other dominant deterministic mechanics that overwhelm any stochasticity.

**Hypothesis:**
P0.3 eliminated ONE source of determinism (cascade trigger timing), but the **consequences** of the cascade (population mortality, resource depletion, economic collapse) are likely deterministic formulas that produce identical results regardless of when the cascade triggers.

**Investigation Areas (Priority Order):**

1. **Population Mortality Calculations** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - File: `src/simulation/populationDynamics.ts`
   - Likely issue: Mortality rates use deterministic percentages (e.g., `mortality = 0.02 * severity`)
   - Expected: Should have random variation (e.g., normal distribution around base rate)
   - Investigation: Search for mortality calculations, check if `Math.random()` appears
   - Impact: If deterministic, explains identical 0.34B population endpoint

2. **Resource Depletion Rates**
   - Files: `src/simulation/freshwater.ts`, `src/simulation/food.ts`, resource system files
   - Likely issue: Depletion follows fixed formulas (e.g., `water -= 0.05 * population`)
   - Expected: Should have stochastic variation (weather variation, regional differences)
   - Investigation: Check if resource changes use random variation
   - Impact: If deterministic, explains identical resource collapse trajectories

3. **Environmental Degradation Feedback Loops**
   - Files: `src/simulation/environmental.ts`, `src/simulation/planetaryBoundaries.ts`
   - Likely issue: Climate/biodiversity degradation uses fixed rates
   - Expected: Should have uncertainty bounds (¬±20-50% variation)
   - Investigation: Check if environmental updates use stochastic variation
   - Impact: If deterministic, explains identical environmental collapse

4. **Economic Collapse Mechanics**
   - File: `src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts`, `src/simulation/economics.ts`
   - Likely issue: GDP multipliers, unemployment rates may be deterministic functions
   - Expected: Should have market volatility, variable recovery rates
   - Investigation: Check if economic calculations use random shocks
   - Impact: If deterministic, explains identical organizational outcomes

5. **Crisis Death Calculations**
   - Files: Crisis-related mortality functions across all systems
   - Likely issue: Death rates from famine/disease/climate may use fixed percentages
   - Expected: Should vary based on random factors (severity, regional variation, adaptation)
   - Investigation: Trace all `addAcuteCrisisDeaths` and `addChronicCrisisDeaths` calls
   - Impact: If deterministic, explains identical death tolls

**Recommended Diagnostic Approach:**

```typescript
// Add comprehensive logging to trace determinism sources
// File: src/simulation/engine.ts or create new diagnostics.ts

export function logDeterminismDiagnostics(state: GameState, month: number): void {
  if (month % 12 === 0) { // Log annually
    console.log(`\n=== DETERMINISM DIAGNOSTICS (Month ${month}) ===`);

    // Population mortality
    const mortalityRate = state.humanPopulationSystem.mortalityRate;
    console.log(`Mortality Rate: ${mortalityRate.toFixed(6)} (should vary across runs)`);

    // Resource depletion
    console.log(`Water Reserves: ${state.resources.water.toFixed(6)}`);
    console.log(`Food Production: ${state.resources.food.toFixed(6)}`);

    // Environmental metrics
    console.log(`Climate Stability: ${state.planetaryBoundariesSystem.climateStability.toFixed(6)}`);
    console.log(`Biodiversity: ${state.planetaryBoundariesSystem.biodiversity.toFixed(6)}`);

    // Economic metrics
    console.log(`GDP: ${state.economy.gdp.toFixed(6)}`);
    console.log(`Organizations Bankrupt: ${state.organizations.filter(o => o.bankrupt).length}`);

    console.log(`================================\n`);
  }
}
```

Run this across 3-5 Monte Carlo runs and compare outputs. Metrics that are IDENTICAL across runs reveal deterministic systems.

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Identify at least 3 specific deterministic formulas causing convergence
- [ ] Document exact line numbers and function names of deterministic code
- [ ] Verify that fixes to these systems produce Monte Carlo variance
- [ ] Achieve >20% variance in population endpoints across 10 runs

**Success Metric:**
After fixes, 10-run Monte Carlo should show population range of 0.3B to 3B (not 0.34B in all 10 runs).

### P0.5: Add Stochasticity to Crisis Mortality (2-3 hours)
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Deterministic death rates cause convergence
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è **BLOCKED** by P0.4 (implement after identifying specific formulas)

**Problem:**
Crisis deaths likely use deterministic percentages (e.g., "2% of population dies per month during cascade"). This causes identical mortality trajectories across Monte Carlo runs.

**Expected Fix:**
```typescript
// File: src/simulation/populationDynamics.ts or crisis mortality functions

// OLD (suspected deterministic code):
const monthlyMortalityRate = 0.02 * cascadeSeverity; // Fixed 2%
const deaths = population * monthlyMortalityRate;

// NEW: Add stochastic variation
const baseMortalityRate = 0.02 * cascadeSeverity;
const randomVariation = 0.7 + Math.random() * 0.6; // 70% to 130% of base (¬±30%)
const monthlyMortalityRate = baseMortalityRate * randomVariation;
const deaths = population * monthlyMortalityRate;

console.log(`Crisis Mortality: ${(monthlyMortalityRate * 100).toFixed(2)}% (base: ${(baseMortalityRate * 100).toFixed(2)}%)`);
```

**Alternative Approach: Normal Distribution**
```typescript
// More realistic: Use normal distribution for mortality variation
import { randomNormal } from '../utils/random'; // Implement Box-Muller transform

const baseMortalityRate = 0.02 * cascadeSeverity;
const stdDev = baseMortalityRate * 0.2; // 20% standard deviation
const monthlyMortalityRate = Math.max(0, randomNormal(baseMortalityRate, stdDev));
```

**Apply to All Crisis Types:**
- Famine mortality (food shortage deaths)
- Disease mortality (healthcare collapse deaths)
- Climate mortality (extreme weather deaths)
- Ecosystem mortality (ecological collapse deaths)
- Conflict mortality (instability/war deaths)

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Monthly mortality rates vary by ¬±20-40% across runs (same month, different seeds)
- [ ] Final population varies by >20% across 10 Monte Carlo runs
- [ ] Death tolls differ across runs even with identical cascade trigger timing

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/simulation/populationDynamics.ts` (main mortality calculation)
- `src/simulation/crisis/*.ts` (crisis-specific death calculations)
- `src/simulation/environmental.ts` (environmental mortality)

**References:**
- Historical mortality variance: Spanish Flu killed 1-5% in different regions
- COVID-19: 0.1-1.5% mortality variation by country
- P0.4 investigation findings (will identify specific functions)

---

### P0.6: Add Stochasticity to Resource Dynamics (2-3 hours)
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Deterministic resource depletion causes convergence
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è **BLOCKED** by P0.4 (implement after identifying specific formulas)

**Problem:**
Resource depletion (food, water, materials) likely follows deterministic formulas (e.g., "depletion = population * 0.01 per month"). This causes identical resource collapse across Monte Carlo runs.

**Expected Fix:**
```typescript
// File: src/simulation/freshwater.ts, food.ts, etc.

// OLD (suspected deterministic code):
const monthlyDepletion = population * 0.01; // Fixed depletion rate
waterReserves -= monthlyDepletion;

// NEW: Add stochastic variation
const baseDepletion = population * 0.01;
const weatherVariation = 0.8 + Math.random() * 0.4; // 80% to 120% (¬±20% weather)
const efficiencyVariation = 0.9 + Math.random() * 0.2; // 90% to 110% (¬±10% efficiency)
const monthlyDepletion = baseDepletion * weatherVariation * efficiencyVariation;
waterReserves -= monthlyDepletion;

console.log(`Water Depletion: ${monthlyDepletion.toFixed(2)} (weather: ${(weatherVariation * 100).toFixed(0)}%)`);
```

**Apply to All Resource Types:**

1. **Freshwater:**
   - Add precipitation variation (¬±30% month-to-month)
   - Add regional drought/flood events (rare but impactful)
   - Add aquifer recharge variation

2. **Food Production:**
   - Add crop yield variation (¬±20-40% based on weather)
   - Add harvest failure probability (1-5% chance of major loss)
   - Add pest/blight events (rare but severe)

3. **Materials/Minerals:**
   - Add extraction efficiency variation (¬±10-20%)
   - Add discovery probability (new reserves found)
   - Add recycling rate variation

4. **Energy:**
   - Add renewable production variation (wind/solar intermittency)
   - Add fossil fuel extraction volatility
   - Add infrastructure failure probability

**Example: Food Production Stochasticity**
```typescript
// File: src/simulation/food.ts

function updateFoodProduction(state: GameState): void {
  const baseProduction = calculateBaseProduction(state);

  // Weather variation (normal distribution)
  const weatherImpact = randomNormal(1.0, 0.15); // Mean 1.0, std dev 15%

  // Catastrophic failure (rare but severe)
  const harvestFailure = Math.random() < 0.02 ? 0.3 : 1.0; // 2% chance of 70% loss

  // Regional variation
  const regionalVariation = 0.85 + Math.random() * 0.3; // 85% to 115%

  const actualProduction = baseProduction * weatherImpact * harvestFailure * regionalVariation;

  state.resources.food = actualProduction;

  console.log(`Food Production: ${actualProduction.toFixed(2)} ` +
              `(weather: ${(weatherImpact * 100).toFixed(0)}%, ` +
              `failure: ${harvestFailure < 1 ? 'YES' : 'no'})`);
}
```

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Resource levels vary by ¬±15-30% across runs at same month
- [ ] Some runs experience catastrophic resource events, others don't
- [ ] Carrying capacity endpoints vary by >20% across 10 Monte Carlo runs
- [ ] Resource trajectories diverge after Month 20-30 (not lockstep decline)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/simulation/freshwater.ts` (water system)
- `src/simulation/food.ts` (food production)
- `src/simulation/resources.ts` (general resource management)
- `src/simulation/environmental.ts` (resource-environment interactions)

**References:**
- Agricultural yield variation: ¬±20-50% year-to-year (USDA data)
- Water availability: ¬±30-70% seasonal variation (NOAA data)
- P0.4 investigation findings (will identify specific functions)

---

## Priority 2: MEDIUM - Improve Within 2-4 Weeks

**Goal:** Research-grade quality with empirical validation
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (40-60 hours total)
**Outcome:** Publication-ready simulation

### P2.1: Recalibrate Environmental Degradation Rates (4-6 hours)
**Severity:** üî¥ HIGH (but can defer after P0/P1) - 100-1000x too fast

**Problem:**
- Climate: 69% degradation in 60 months ‚Üí 13x faster than IPCC worst-case
- Biodiversity: 99.4% collapse in 60 months ‚Üí 200x faster than IPBES projections
- Resources: 84% depletion in 60 months ‚Üí 34x faster than Global Footprint Network

**Current Rates:**
```typescript
// environmental.ts
biodiversityLossRate = economicStage * 0.0004; // 0.04% per month
// Still 10-20x faster than IPBES (1% per decade = 0.0083% per month)
```

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// File: /src/simulation/environmental.ts

// BIODIVERSITY (lines 193-217):
// OLD:
let biodiversityLossRate = economicStage * 0.0004; // 0.04% per month

// NEW: Match IPBES (1% per decade)
let biodiversityLossRate = economicStage * 0.00008; // 0.008% per month = 1% per decade at Stage 1

// CLIMATE (lines 146-169):
// OLD:
climateImpact = economicStage * 0.003; // 0.3% per month

// NEW: Match IPCC SSP5-8.5 (+4.4¬∞C by 2100 = 75 years)
climateImpact = economicStage * 0.0006; // 0.06% per month = 0.7% per year

// RESOURCES (lines 62-86):
// OLD:
resourceDepletionRate = economicStage * 0.008; // 0.8% per month

// NEW: Match Global Footprint Network (~0.5% per year worsening)
resourceDepletionRate = economicStage * 0.0004; // 0.04% per month = 0.5% per year
```

**Add Uncertainty Bounds:**
```typescript
// Add ¬±50% variance to all rates
const variance = 0.5 + Math.random(); // 0.5x to 1.5x
biodiversityLossRate *= variance;
```

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Climate degradation reaches "catastrophe" by 2100 (Month 900), not 2030 (Month 60)
- [ ] Biodiversity declines 10-20% by 2050 (Month 300), not 99% by 2030
- [ ] Resource depletion follows GFN overshoot trajectory (1.7x ‚Üí 2.5x by 2100)

### P2.2: Add Stochastic Innovation / Breakthroughs (4-6 hours)
**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM - Missing positive unknown unknowns

**Problem:**
- Technology tree follows predetermined paths
- Real innovation leaps prerequisites: CRISPR, Transformers, mRNA vaccines
- No "miracle" breakthroughs that could avert catastrophe

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// File: Create /src/simulation/engine/phases/BreakthroughInnovationPhase.ts

export function executeBreakthroughInnovationPhase(state: GameState): void {
  // Higher probability during existential crisis (necessity breeds innovation)

  const totalBreakthroughProb = baseBreakthroughProb + crisisPressure + aiBoost;

  if (Math.random() < totalBreakthroughProb) {
    // Random breakthrough bypasses tech tree
    const breakthroughType = selectRandomBreakthrough();

    switch (breakthroughType) {
      case 'fusion':
        // Unlimited clean energy
        state.technologies.fusionPower.unlocked = true;
        state.technologies.fusionPower.deploymentLevel = 0.1;

        state.humanPopulationSystem.carryingCapacity *= 1.5;
        console.log(`üçñ BREAKTHROUGH: Synthetic food solves scarcity!`);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

**Test Criteria:**

### P2.3: Heterogeneous Population Segments (8-10 hours)
**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM - Missing social dynamics

**Problem:**
- Society modeled as monolithic (single trust/legitimacy values)
- Real populations: 30-40% variance in responses, polarization, elite/mass gaps

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// File: /src/types/game.ts

interface Society {
  // OLD: Single values
  // trustInAI: number;
  // legitimacy: number;

  // NEW: Heterogeneous segments
  segments: SocietySegment[];
  aggregateTrustInAI: number; // Weighted average for backward compatibility
  aggregateLegitimacy: number;
}

interface SocietySegment {
  name: 'techno-optimists' | 'moderates' | 'skeptics' | 'elites';
  populationFraction: number; // 0-1, sum to 1.0
  trustInAI: number; // 0-1
  trustInGovernment: number;
  politicalPower: number; // Weighted influence (elites have >population fraction)
  geographic: string[]; // Regions (e.g., ['urban', 'coastal'])
  adaptability: number; // Ability to cope with crisis (0-1)
}

// Example initialization:
society.segments = [
  { name: 'techno-optimists', populationFraction: 0.15, trustInAI: 0.8, politicalPower: 0.25, ...  },
  { name: 'moderates', populationFraction: 0.50, trustInAI: 0.5, politicalPower: 0.50, ... },
  { name: 'skeptics', populationFraction: 0.30, trustInAI: 0.2, politicalPower: 0.20, ... },
  { name: 'elites', populationFraction: 0.05, trustInAI: 0.7, politicalPower: 0.40, ... }, // Disproportionate power
];
```

**Impact:** Policy decisions depend on weighted segments, not uniform population

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Government AI deployment succeeds if weighted-power-trust > 0.6 (not just average trust)
- [ ] Elite segment can insulate from crisis (higher survival rate)
- [ ] Some segments polarize (trust diverges over time)

### P2.4: Organization Geographic Diversification (3-4 hours)
**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM - Oversimplified economics

**Problem:**
- Organizations treated as single-country entities
- Real: Google operates in 170 countries, 50+ data centers globally
- 100% bankruptcy unrealistic (COVID-19: tech companies thrived)

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// File: /src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts

interface Organization {
  // ADD:
  geographicPresence: {
    region: string;
    populationShare: number; // % of operations in this region
    dataCenters: number;
    workforce: number;
  }[];

  remoteWorkCapable: boolean; // Can shift to remote operations
  essentialDesignation: boolean; // Government will bail out
}

function calculateBankruptcyRisk(org: Organization, state: GameState): number {
  // OLD: Binary threshold
  // if (countryPop < 0.50 * countryPeakPop) return 1.0; // 100% bankruptcy

  // NEW: Weighted across geographic presence
  let weightedCollapse = 0;

  org.geographicPresence.forEach(presence => {
    const region = state.regions[presence.region];
    const popDecline = 1 - (region.currentPop / region.peakPop);
    weightedCollapse += popDecline * presence.populationShare;
  });

  // Sigmoid curve (not binary threshold)
  let bankruptcyRisk = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-10 * (weightedCollapse - 0.6))); // 50% risk at 60% decline

  // Adjustments
  if (org.remoteWorkCapable) bankruptcyRisk *= 0.5; // 50% risk reduction
  if (org.essentialDesignation) bankruptcyRisk *= 0.3; // Government bailout

  return bankruptcyRisk;
}
```

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Distributed organizations (Google, Microsoft) survive longer than regional ones
- [ ] At least 10-30% of organizations survive severe collapse (not 0%)
- [ ] Government-designated "essential" AI companies get bailouts

### P2.5: Empirical Validation Against Historical Data (6-8 hours)
**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM - Necessary for credibility

**Goal:** Prove simulation can reproduce known events

**Validation Scenarios:**

**1. COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2023):**
```
Initialize: 2020 state (population 7.8B, AI capability 0.3)
Trigger: Pandemic event (2-5M deaths)
Expected Outcomes:
  - Tech company revenue: +20-40% (Google, Amazon, Microsoft)
  - Remote work adoption: 30-50%
  - Vaccine development: 12-18 months
  - Economic recovery: 2021-2022
  - Population impact: <0.1% mortality

Test: Does simulation match observed trajectory?
```

**2. 2008 Financial Crisis:**
```
Initialize: 2008 state
Trigger: Market crash (housing bubble)
Expected Outcomes:
  - 10-30% organizational bankruptcies (not 100%)
  - Government bailouts (TARP)
  - Recovery by 2010-2012
  - Tech sector resilient (Apple, Google survived)

Test: Does simulation match organizational survival rates?
```

**3. Black Death (1347-1353):**
```
Initialize: Medieval population/tech (adjust parameters to 1347 levels)
Trigger: Pandemic (30-60% mortality over 6 years)
Expected Outcomes:
  - Population: 75M ‚Üí 45M ‚Üí 78M by 1450
  - Recovery: 1% annual growth post-crisis
  - Economic changes: Wages increase, labor scarcity

Test: Does simulation show recovery (not extinction)?
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] COVID-19: Matches mortality (<0.1%), tech growth (+20-40%), recovery timeline
- [ ] 2008 Crisis: Organizational survival 70-90%, recovery by 2012
- [ ] Black Death: 30-60% mortality, full recovery within 100 years

## Priority 3: LOW - Nice-to-Have Improvements

**Goal:** Cutting-edge research features
**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks (optional)
**Outcome:** State-of-the-art simulation

### P3.1: Variable Timesteps / Event-Driven Architecture (10-12 hours)
### P3.2: Unknown Unknown Event System (4-6 hours)
### P3.3: Alignment Model Specificity (2-3 hours)
### P3.4: Government Implementation Realism (3-4 hours)
### P3.5: Continuous Parameter Uncertainty (6-8 hours)

*(Detailed specs available in architecture-review-20251015.md and research-validation-20251015.md)*

---

## Testing & Validation Strategy

### After Each Priority Level:

**Post-P0 (2-3 days):**
```bash
# Status: PARTIAL - P0.1-P0.3 complete, P0.4-P0.6 in progress

# Already completed verification:
# ‚úÖ AI capability growth: 7,943x over 10 years (was 2.4x)
# ‚úÖ Organizations: Bankruptcy mechanics fixed (no impossible revenue)
# ‚úÖ Cascade trigger: Stochastic mechanism working (Month 13, 9.22% probability)

# Outstanding verification (FAILED):
# ‚ùå Outcome variance: ALL 10 runs converged to 0.34B population (IDENTICAL)
# ‚ùå Monte Carlo variance: Still 100% convergence despite stochastic trigger

# Next steps (P0.4-P0.6):
# 1. Run diagnostic logging across 3-5 runs to identify deterministic systems
# 2. Add stochasticity to mortality, resources, environmental systems
# 3. Re-run 10-run Monte Carlo to verify variance >20%

# Target verification (after P0.4-P0.6):
- [ ] Outcome variance (not 100% same outcome)
- [ ] Population endpoints vary by >20% across runs (e.g., 0.3B to 3B range)
- [x] AI capability reaches >2.0 in some runs
- [x] Organizations show realistic survival/bankruptcy rates
- [ ] Death accounting sums correctly (P1.1)

# If outcome variance check STILL fails after P0.6, escalate for deeper investigation
```

**Post-P1 (1 week):**
```bash
# Run 500-run Monte Carlo for statistical confidence
npm run monte-carlo -- --runs 500 --months 600

# Check for:
- [ ] Population decline rates match historical precedent (5-10% annual max)
- [ ] Environmental degradation aligns with IPCC/IPBES projections
- [ ] Some runs show recovery (5-15%)
- [ ] Mortality breakdown accounts for 90%+ of deaths

# Run historical validation
npm run validate:covid19
npm run validate:2008crisis
npm run validate:blackdeath
```

**Post-P2 (2-4 weeks):**
```bash
# Full sensitivity analysis
npm run sensitivity-analysis

# Expert review
- Share with AI safety researchers
- Share with Earth system scientists
- Share with economists
- Incorporate feedback

# Publication prep
- Generate outcome distribution charts
- Document all parameters with citations
- Write methods section
- Prepare supplementary materials
```

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk: Fixes introduce new bugs**
- Mitigation: Regression test suite (run after each fix)
- Tests: Death accounting, population dynamics, outcome determination

**Risk: Parameter recalibration changes conclusions**
- Mitigation: Sensitivity analysis (test multiple parameterizations)
- Document: Which parameters drive outcomes most strongly

**Risk: Expert reviewers find additional issues**
- Mitigation: Incorporate feedback iteratively
- Plan for 2-3 rounds of expert review

**Risk: Historical validation fails**
- Mitigation: Calibrate parameters to match known events first
- Example: COVID-19 must show tech company resilience, not 100% bankruptcy

---

## Communication Plan

**Internal (Development Team):**
- Daily: P0/P1 fix progress updates
- Weekly: Monte Carlo test results
- Bi-weekly: Parameter recalibration decisions

**External (Stakeholders):**
