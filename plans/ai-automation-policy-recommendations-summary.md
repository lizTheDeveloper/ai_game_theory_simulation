## Recommended Policy Mix (Pending Verification)

### Tier 1: Deploy Immediately (Validated)

**Universal Basic Income**
- **Level:** 40% of median wage (~$24k/year in US 2024)
- **Evidence:** Economic Policy Institute (2024), Brookings (2021)
- **Cost:** ~$4.8 trillion/year (US), scales with population
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents productivity-wage decoupling (84% improvement)
  - Raises labor bargaining power
  - Provides income floor during automation transition
- **Risks:**
  - May reduce QoL without complementary programs (12% worse in testing)
  - Potential inflation concerns
  - Work identity / meaning crisis without retraining
- **Mitigation:** Combine with purpose infrastructure (TIER 2.1) and social safety nets (TIER 2.2)

### Tier 2: Implement with Caution (Requires Debugging)

**Retraining Programs**
- **Level:** 50-70% coverage (target displaced workers)
- **Evidence:** OECD (2019) - should reduce displacement 30-50%
- **Status:** ⚠️ **CONFLICTS WITH RESEARCH** - increased gaps instead of reducing
- **Action Required:**
  1. Debug `calculateRetrainingEffect()` implementation
  2. Verify segment-level application
  3. Re-test with multiple seeds before deployment
- **Hold Recommendation Until:** Debugging complete and multi-seed validation passed

**Teaching Support Programs**
- **Level:** 50-70% coverage (AI-human pedagogy)
- **Evidence:** Frontiers Psychology (2024) - should improve retention 40% → 80%
- **Status:** ⚠️ **CONFLICTS WITH RESEARCH** - increased competence gaps
- **Action Required:**
  1. Investigate scaffolding vs competence interaction
  2. Verify `applyTeachingSupport()` logic
  3. Check for emergent dependency effects
- **Hold Recommendation Until:** Research conflict resolved

**Job Guarantee Programs**
- **Level:** 50% coverage (optional federal employment)
- **Evidence:** Brookings (2021), Argentina pilots
- **Benefits:** Creates 5-20% unemployment floor
- **Risks:** Doesn't address wages or skills, may reduce QoL
- **Deployment:** As backup to UBI, not primary policy

### Tier 3: Combined Strategy (Once Debugged)

**Optimal Mix (Target for 2030-2035):**
```
UBI:              30-40% median wage
Retraining:       50-70% coverage (after debug)
Teaching Support: 50-70% coverage (after debug)
Job Guarantee:    30-50% coverage (safety net)
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Wage gap: <5% (healthy range)
- Labor share: >60% (fair distribution)
- Competence gap: <10% (manageable AI dependency)
- Quality of Life: >65% (high well-being)

**Current Status:**
Combined policies showed mixed results (1.8% wage gap but 11% competence gap). Requires component-level debugging before integrated deployment.

   - Gradual scaling from 10% → 40% coverage
   - Means-tested transition to universal
   - Coordinate with tax system reforms

2. **Universal Retraining Access** (2-3 years)
   - Build training infrastructure
   - Subsidize employer-provided retraining
   - Integrate with unemployment systems

3. **Education System Integration** (3-5 years)

   - Train teachers in scaffolding design
   - Deploy at scale K-12, higher ed, vocational

## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: UBI Without Meaning Programs
**Risk:** UBI provides income but not purpose, causing meaning crisis and QoL decline (observed: -12% QoL).

**Mitigation:**
- Deploy Enhanced UBI Systems (TIER 2.1) - purpose infrastructure included
- Activate Social Safety Nets (TIER 2.2) - community connection programs
- Integrate with Meaning Renaissance system (existing in simulation)
- Expected outcome: QoL improvement instead of decline

### Risk 2: Policy Implementation Bugs
**Risk:** Retraining and Teaching Support show opposite-of-expected effects, suggesting code bugs.

**Mitigation:**
- Complete debugging before any real-world recommendations
- Multi-seed validation (N=20+) to verify robustness
- Phased pilots with close monitoring
- Halt deployment if effects don't match research

### Risk 3: Crisis Confounding
**Risk:** All scenarios experienced tipping cascade at month 53, making policy comparison difficult.

**Mitigation:**
- Measure policy effects in months 0-50 (pre-crisis)
- Test policies under "normal trajectory" conditions
- Separate policy effectiveness from crisis resilience
- Run crisis-free scenarios for baseline comparison

### Risk 4: Regional Variation
**Risk:** Policies tested globally-uniform, but real deployment varies by country/region.

**Mitigation:**
- Test policies in specific countries (US, EU, China, India)
- Account for different baseline conditions (GDP, safety nets, education)
- Model policy diffusion speeds and adoption rates
- Develop region-specific policy mixes
