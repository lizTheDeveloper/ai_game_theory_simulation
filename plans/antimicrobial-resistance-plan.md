# Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis - Implementation Plan

**Date Created:** October 17, 2025
**Priority:** MEDIUM (Missing negative mechanism - baseline mortality realism)
**Status:** READY TO IMPLEMENT - Research validated (TRL 9 - WHO projections)
**Estimated Complexity:** 4-7 hours (4 interacting systems: health, mortality, technology, medical infrastructure)

---

## Executive Summary

Implement progressive loss of antibiotic effectiveness: baseline mortality increases over time as routine infections become untreatable, surgeries become risky, healthcare effectiveness declines. WHO projects 10 million annual deaths by 2050 (baseline scenario, no major interventions).

**Expected Impact:** Baseline mortality increase over time (currently model assumes constant medical effectiveness)

**Research Foundation:**
- WHO (2024): 10M annual deaths by 2050 from antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
- O'Neill Review (2016): 10M annual deaths by 2050, $100T cumulative economic damage
- Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators (2022, Lancet): 1.27M deaths in 2019, increasing 10%/year

## Research Foundation

### Core Mechanism: Antibiotic Overuse → Resistance → Medical Effectiveness Decline

**WHO (2024) - "Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance":**
- Current deaths (2019): 1.27 million directly attributable to AMR
- Projected deaths (2050): 10 million annually (baseline scenario, no action)
- Growth rate: ~10% annual increase (exponential)
- TRL 9: Empirical surveillance data, 100+ countries, ongoing monitoring

**O'Neill Review (2016) - "Tackling Drug-Resistant Infections Globally":**
- Economic damage: $100 trillion cumulative by 2050
- Mechanisms: Routine surgeries risky, cancer chemotherapy ineffective, neonatal deaths ↑
- Geographic variation: Low/middle-income countries hit harder (less access to new antibiotics)
- TRL 9: Economic modeling + epidemiological projections

**Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators (2022, Lancet):**
- 1.27M deaths (2019) directly attributable
- 4.95M deaths associated with AMR (indirect)
- Leading pathogens: E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae
- TRL 9: Systematic analysis, 204 countries, validated methodology

## Mechanism Specification

### 1. Baseline AMR Mortality Progression

**Annual Death Rate Growth:**
```typescript
interface AntimicrobialResistance {
  currentDeathRate: number; // Annual deaths per 100K population
  baselineDeathRate: number; // 2025 baseline (16 per 100K globally)
  growthRate: number; // Annual percentage increase (10% baseline)
  targetDeathRate: number; // 2050 target (125 per 100K for 10M deaths)
}

function calculateAMRMortality(state: GameState): number {
  const yearsSince2025 = (state.currentMonth - 0) / 12;
  const amr = state.health.antimicrobialResistance;

  // Exponential growth: Deaths(t) = Baseline * (1 + growthRate)^years
  const currentDeathRate = amr.baselineDeathRate * Math.pow(1 + amr.growthRate, yearsSince2025);

  // Cap at 2050 WHO projection (125 per 100K for 10M annual deaths)
  return Math.min(currentDeathRate, amr.targetDeathRate);
}
```

**Monthly Mortality:**
```typescript
function applyAMRMortality(state: GameState) {
  const annualDeathRatePer100K = calculateAMRMortality(state);
  const monthlyDeathRate = annualDeathRatePer100K / 12 / 100000; // Convert to monthly fraction

  const amrDeaths = state.population.total * monthlyDeathRate;
  state.population.monthlyDeaths += amrDeaths;

  // Track AMR as cause of death
  state.health.deathsByCause.antimicrobialResistance += amrDeaths;
}
```

---

### 2. Medical Effectiveness Decline

**Healthcare System Degradation:**
```typescript
function calculateMedicalEffectivenessFromAMR(state: GameState): number {
  const amr = state.health.antimicrobialResistance;
  const currentDeathRate = calculateAMRMortality(state);
  const baselineDeathRate = amr.baselineDeathRate; // 2025 baseline

  // Medical effectiveness decline proportional to AMR increase
  // 2025: 100% effective, 2050: 70% effective (30% decline)
  const effectivenessDecline = (currentDeathRate - baselineDeathRate) / (amr.targetDeathRate - baselineDeathRate);
  const medicalEffectiveness = 1.0 - (effectivenessDecline * 0.30); // Cap at 30% decline

  return Math.max(medicalEffectiveness, 0.7); // Floor at 70% (some treatments still work)
}

// Apply to healthcare system
function applyMedicalEffectivenessDecline(state: GameState) {
  const effectiveness = calculateMedicalEffectivenessFromAMR(state);

  // Reduce healthcare quality-of-life impact
  state.globalMetrics.qualityOfLife.health.healthcareAccess *= effectiveness;

  // Increase risk from surgeries, childbirth, cancer treatment
  state.health.surgeryRisk *= (2.0 - effectiveness); // 2x risk by 2050
  state.health.maternalMortalityRate *= (2.0 - effectiveness);
  state.health.cancerSurvivalRate *= effectiveness;
}
```

---

### 3. Geographic & Socioeconomic Variation

**Regional Variation:**
```typescript
// WHO data: Low/middle-income countries hit harder
function getRegionalAMRMultiplier(region: Region): number {
  if (region.incomeLevel === 'low') return 1.8; // 80% higher AMR mortality
  if (region.incomeLevel === 'middle') return 1.3; // 30% higher
  if (region.incomeLevel === 'high') return 0.7; // 30% lower (access to new antibiotics)
  return 1.0;
}

// Apply regional variation
function applyRegionalAMRMortality(state: GameState) {
  for (const region of state.regions) {
    const baseAMR = calculateAMRMortality(state);
    const regionalMultiplier = getRegionalAMRMultiplier(region);
    const regionalAMR = baseAMR * regionalMultiplier;

    const regionalDeaths = region.population * (regionalAMR / 12 / 100000);
    region.monthlyDeaths += regionalDeaths;
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Technology Interventions (Mitigation)

**New Antibiotics & Alternatives:**
```typescript
// Breakthrough technologies can slow/reverse AMR
const amrMitigationTechnologies = [
  'phage-therapy', // TRL 6-7: Bacteriophage alternatives
  'narrow-spectrum-antibiotics', // TRL 7-8: Precision antibiotics
  'antibiotic-stewardship-ai', // TRL 6: AI-optimized prescribing
  'novel-antibiotics', // TRL 3-5: New antibiotic classes (slow pipeline)
];

function applyAMRMitigation(state: GameState) {
  let mitigationFactor = 1.0; // Baseline: no mitigation

  for (const tech of amrMitigationTechnologies) {
    if (state.technologies.deployed.includes(tech)) {
      // Each technology reduces AMR growth rate
      mitigationFactor *= 0.85; // 15% reduction per technology
    }
  }

  // Apply to AMR growth rate
  state.health.antimicrobialResistance.growthRate *= mitigationFactor;

  // Deep mitigation (4 technologies): 10% → 5% growth (halving)
  // Partial mitigation (2 technologies): 10% → 7.2% growth
}
```

       growthRate: number; // 0.10 (10% annual increase)
       targetDeathRate: number; // 125 per 100K (2050 WHO projection)
     }
     ```

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics:

**After Implementation:**
- Baseline mortality increases over time (2025: 1.27M deaths, 2050: 10M deaths)
- Medical effectiveness declines 30% by 2050 (100% → 70%)
- AMR mitigation technologies slow growth (10% → 5% with full mitigation)

### Secondary Metrics:

- Regional variation: Low-income countries 1.8x mortality vs high-income
- Technology impact: Phage therapy + narrow-spectrum antibiotics reduce growth 25-30%
- Historical calibration: 2019 1.27M deaths matches Lancet data

---

## Validation Strategy

### Phase 1: Unit Testing (1h)
- Test AMR mortality growth (2025: 16/100K → 2050: 125/100K)
- Test medical effectiveness decline (100% → 70%)
- Test technology mitigation (10% growth → 5% with 4 technologies)

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (1-2h)
- Test AMR mortality → population deaths linkage
- Test medical effectiveness → healthcare quality-of-life impact
- Test regional variation (low-income 1.8x, high-income 0.7x)

### Phase 3: Historical Calibration (1-2h)
- **2019 baseline:** 1.27M deaths (Lancet 2022 validation)
- **2025 projection:** ~2M deaths (10% annual growth)
- **2050 projection:** 10M deaths (WHO baseline scenario)
- Test: Does simulation match empirical trajectory?

## Risk Assessment

**Risk 1: Growth Rate Too High**
- **Mitigation:** Conservative 10% annual (WHO baseline, not worst-case)
- **Fallback:** Reduce to 7-8% if AMR deaths dominate all other causes

**Risk 2: Medical Effectiveness Decline Too Strong**
- **Mitigation:** Cap at 30% decline (70% floor, some treatments still work)
- **Fallback:** Reduce to 20% decline if healthcare collapses unrealistically

**Risk 3: Technology Mitigation Too Weak**
- **Mitigation:** 15% reduction per technology (conservative, TRL 6-8)
- **Fallback:** Increase to 20% if technologies have no observable impact

**Risk 4: Regional Variation Too Extreme**
- **Mitigation:** 1.8x multiplier for low-income (not 3-5x)
- **Fallback:** Reduce to 1.5x if inequality effects dominate

---

## Timeline & Effort

**Total Complexity:** 4 systems (health, mortality, technology, medical infrastructure)
**Total Effort:** 4-7 hours

**Phase Breakdown:**
- AMR mortality progression: 1-2h
- Medical effectiveness decline: 1-2h
