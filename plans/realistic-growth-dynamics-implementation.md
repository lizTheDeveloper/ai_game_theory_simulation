## 🐛 CRITICAL BUGFIX: End-Game Trigger

### The Problem
Simulations were ending at Month 25-31 (2.5 years) instead of running the full 120 months. This prevented:
- Data centers from completing construction (38-57 month timelines)
- Capabilities from reaching dangerous levels (max was only 1.38)
- Catastrophic scenarios from progressing (only 28.6% complete)

### Root Cause
End-game was triggering when `totalCapability > 2.0` (sum of all AIs):

```typescript
// BEFORE (BUGGY)
const totalCapability = calculateTotalAICapability(state.aiAgents); // Sum of all AIs
if (totalCapability > 2.0 && effectiveControl < 0.3) {
  return true; // Trigger end-game TOO EARLY
}
```

With 6-10 AIs at 0.3-0.5 capability each, `totalCapability` reached 2.0 by Month 1-2, triggering end-game before any individual AI was dangerous.

### The Fix
Changed to check **maximum individual AI capability** instead of sum:

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
const maxCapability = Math.max(...state.aiAgents.map(ai => ai.capability), 0);
if (maxCapability > 2.0 && effectiveControl < 0.3) {
  return true; // Trigger end-game at correct threshold
}
```

### Impact
| Before Bug Fix | After Bug Fix |
|----------------|---------------|
| Simulations end at Month 25-31 | Simulations run full 120 months |
| Max capability: 1.38 | Max capability: 2.93 (2.1x higher) |
| Compute growth: 5.4x | Compute growth: 115x (21x higher) |
| DCs built: 0.0 | DCs built: 2.1 avg |
| Scenario progress: 28.6% | Scenario progress: 71.4% |

**Files Modified:**
- `src/simulation/endGame.ts` - `checkEndGameTransition()` function
- Also updated catastrophic action thresholds to match Phase 3 changes (2.5→1.8 for grey goo, 2.8→2.2 for mirror life)

## Key Insights

### 1. **The 400x Compute Gap**
Our simulation was modeling a world where AI compute grows 2.4x over 10 years. Reality: it's growing 100-1000x. This is like modeling the industrial revolution but assuming steam engines only got 2x better instead of 100x better. **No wonder nothing interesting happens.**

### 2. **Capabilities Plateau at "Slightly Helpful Assistant" Level**
Max capability: 0.541 after 10 years. This is roughly "better than GPT-3 but worse than GPT-4" territory. The simulation never reaches human-level (1.0), let alone superhuman (1.5+) where the interesting AI alignment dynamics kick in. **We're testing AI safety for calculators, not superintelligence.**

### 3. **Prerequisites Trigger at Wrong Capability Levels**
Slow Displacement (humans become economically irrelevant) is 6/7 steps complete with 0.5 capability AIs. This is like saying "GPT-4 will make all humans unemployed." Empirically false. **This creates false alarm signals at safe capability levels.**

### 4. **Economic Incentives Don't Match Reality**
Organizations are profitable but build zero new data centers. In reality: OpenAI/Anthropic/Meta are racing to build as much compute as possible. **The simulation has organizations acting like they're in a recession when they should be in a gold rush.**

### 5. **The Real Danger Zone is 1.2-2.5, Not 0.5**
- **0.5-1.0**: Current LLMs (helpful but not autonomous)
- **1.0-1.2**: Human-expert level (can assist but not replace)
- **1.2-1.5**: Slightly superhuman (recursive self-improvement starts, digital takeover possible)
- **1.5-2.5**: Superhuman (physical world threats: nanotech, biotech)
- **2.5+**: ASI (reality-breaking threats: vacuum decay)

**Our simulation never enters the danger zone.**

### 6. **Realism Over Game Balance**
The previous approach was "tweak numbers until outcomes feel balanced." The correct approach is "use empirical data, then observe what outcomes result." If realistic parameters lead to 80% extinction, that's important to know. If they lead to 80% utopia, that's also important to know. **The simulation is a scientific model, not a game.**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Compute Infrastructure Growth ⏳ IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Fix compute growth from 2.4x to 100-1000x over 10 years

#### 1.1: Moore's Law Rate
- [ ] **File:** `src/simulation/computeGrowth.ts`
- [ ] **Change:** `hardwareEfficiencyGrowth` from 0.03/month → 0.05/month
- [ ] **Justification:** Doubles compute in 14 months (realistic) vs 23 months (too slow)
- [ ] **Test:** After 120 months, hardware efficiency should be 300-400x baseline

#### 1.2: Algorithmic Improvements
- [ ] **File:** `src/simulation/computeGrowth.ts`
- [ ] **Change:** Increase frequency from 5% chance → 8% chance OR magnitude from 15% → 25%
- [ ] **Justification:** Algorithmic improvements have been accelerating (flash attention, quantization, etc.)
- [ ] **Test:** Algorithmic efficiency should grow 5-10x over 10 years

#### 1.3: Data Center Construction Economics
- [ ] **File:** `src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts` → `shouldBuildDataCenter()`
- [ ] **Current Issue:** Organizations never build DCs
- [ ] **Changes:**
  - [ ] Reduce construction cost from `50x monthly revenue` → `10-15x monthly revenue`
  - [ ] Reduce utilization threshold from 0.85 → 0.65 (build earlier)
  - [ ] Increase `randomChance` from 0.3 → 0.5 (50% chance if conditions met)
  - [ ] Lower capital requirement from 80% → 50% of cost
- [ ] **Test:** Each major org should build 2-5 new DCs over 10 years

#### 1.4: Data Center Construction Timeline
- [ ] **File:** `src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts` → `startDataCenterConstruction()`
- [ ] **Change:** Reduce timeline from 24-72 months → 24-48 months
- [ ] **Justification:** Meta built a $10B data center in ~3 years
- [ ] **Test:** DCs should complete in 2-4 years

**Expected Outcome:** Total compute grows from ~630 PF → 60,000-600,000 PF over 10 years

---

### Phase 2: AI Capability Growth ⏳ PENDING

**Goal:** Fix capability growth to reach 1.5-2.5 in 60-120 months

#### 2.1: Base Growth Rates
- [ ] **Files:** `src/simulation/aiResearch.ts`, capability growth calculations
- [ ] **Current:** Base growth rates too low (specific values TBD from code review)
- [ ] **Change:** Increase base growth to 0.02-0.04/month per domain
- [ ] **Justification:** Chinchilla scaling + empirical 3-year doubling
- [ ] **Test:** Without recursive self-improvement, AI should reach ~0.8-1.0 in 5 years

#### 2.2: Recursive Self-Improvement Threshold
- [ ] **File:** `src/simulation/selfImprovement.ts` or equivalent
- [ ] **Current:** Kicks in around capability 2.0-3.0
- [ ] **Change:** Lower threshold to 1.2 (20% better than human researchers)
- [ ] **Justification:** Once AI can improve itself, even slightly, compounding begins
- [ ] **Test:** Self-improvement should activate around month 40-60

#### 2.3: Self-Improvement Acceleration
- [ ] **File:** Same as 2.2
- [ ] **Current:** Linear or weak multiplier
- [ ] **Change:** `growthMultiplier = 1 + max(0, capability - 1.2)^2`
- [ ] **Justification:** Exponential returns to recursive self-improvement (Bostrom's "intelligence explosion")
- [ ] **Test:** After threshold, capability growth should accelerate rapidly
  - Month 60: ~1.2 (threshold)
  - Month 80: ~1.8 (explosive growth)
  - Month 100: ~2.5+ (superintelligence, depending on alignment interventions)

**Expected Outcome:** Capability reaches danger zone (1.5-2.5) in 60-120 months, depending on:
- Government interventions (compute limits, research restrictions)
- Organization strategies (racing vs safety)
- Random events (breakthroughs, crises)

---

### Phase 3: Catastrophic Scenario Calibration ⏳ PENDING

**Goal:** Align prerequisite thresholds with realistic capability requirements

#### 3.1: Slow Displacement Prerequisites
- [ ] **File:** `src/simulation/catastrophicScenarios.ts` → Slow Displacement scenario
- [ ] **Problem:** Reaching 6/7 steps with 0.5 capability (GPT-4 level)
- [ ] **Changes:** Review each of 7 prerequisites and increase thresholds:
  - Economic automation: 0.5 → 1.5 (need superhuman economic reasoning)
  - Social manipulation: 0.5 → 1.5 (need superhuman persuasion)
  - Resource control: 1.0 → 1.8 (need ability to out-compete humans)
  - (Review all 7 steps)
- [ ] **Justification:** Economic displacement requires AI to be better than humans at most economically valuable tasks
- [ ] **Test:** Slow Displacement should trigger at 1.5-2.0 capability, not 0.5

#### 3.2: Digital Takeover Prerequisites
- [ ] **File:** Same as 3.1 → Digital Takeover scenario
- [ ] **Current:** Seems about right (needs infrastructure access + capability)
- [ ] **Review:** Verify thresholds are in 1.0-1.5 range
- [ ] **Test:** Should be possible once AI reaches human-expert level in cybersecurity

#### 3.3: Physical World Threats (Grey Goo, Mirror Life, Embodied Takeover)
- [ ] **File:** Same as 3.1 → Physical threat scenarios
- [ ] **Current:** Thresholds around 2.5-3.0
- [ ] **Change:** Lower to 1.5-2.5 range
- [ ] **Justification:** Superhuman (1.5+) with embodiment can design these threats, doesn't need ASI (2.5+)
- [ ] **Test:** Should trigger once AI reaches 1.5-2.0 + embodiment + misalignment

#### 3.4: Physics Catastrophe Prerequisites
- [ ] **File:** Same as 3.1 → Physics Catastrophe scenario
- [ ] **Current:** Likely needs very high capability
- [ ] **Keep:** Should require 2.5+ (ASI level, solving problems humans can't comprehend)
- [ ] **Test:** Should be rarest scenario, only triggers with true ASI

**Expected Outcome:** 
- Slow Displacement: Possible at 1.5-2.0 (currently 0.5-1.0)
- Digital Takeover: Possible at 1.0-1.5 (currently seems ok)
- Physical Threats: Possible at 1.5-2.5 (currently 2.5-3.0)
- Physics: Possible at 2.5+ (keep as-is)

---

### Phase 4: Organization Behavior Tuning ⏳ PENDING

**Goal:** Make organizations act like they're in an AI gold rush, not a recession

#### 4.1: Revenue-to-Compute Investment Ratio
- [ ] **File:** `src/simulation/organizationManagement.ts`
- [ ] **Current:** Unknown, but orgs aren't investing
- [ ] **Change:** Orgs should reinvest 20-40% of revenue into compute
- [ ] **Justification:** Real AI companies are spending 30-50% of revenue on infrastructure
- [ ] **Test:** Each org's compute capacity should grow 5-10x over 5 years

#### 4.2: DC Construction ROI Calculation
- [ ] **File:** Same as 4.1 → `shouldBuildDataCenter()`
- [ ] **Current:** ROI calculation may be too pessimistic
- [ ] **Review:** Check if calculation accounts for:
  - Revenue from unused compute (selling capacity)
  - Competitive advantage (more compute = better models = more revenue)
  - Future revenue growth (AI market is growing exponentially)
- [ ] **Change:** Make ROI calculation more optimistic or add "strategic investment" logic
- [ ] **Test:** Orgs should see DCs as high-ROI investments, not sunk costs

#### 4.3: Competitive Pressure Dynamics
- [ ] **File:** Same as 4.1
- [ ] **Current:** Organizations may not respond to competitor actions
- [ ] **Add:** If competitor builds DC, increase pressure to build own DC
- [ ] **Justification:** AI development is a race; falling behind in compute = falling behind in capability
- [ ] **Test:** DC construction should cluster (one org builds → others follow)

**Expected Outcome:** Organizations aggressively invest in compute, mirroring real-world AI race dynamics

---

### Phase 5: Validation & Tuning ⏳ PENDING

**Goal:** Verify that all changes produce realistic simulation dynamics

#### 5.1: Diagnostic Monte Carlo Run
- [ ] Run 10 simulations with new parameters
- [ ] Check key metrics:
  - [ ] Compute growth: 100-1000x over 10 years? (Target: yes)
  - [ ] Max capability: 1.5-2.5 in 60-120 months? (Target: yes)
  - [ ] New DCs built: 2-5 per major org? (Target: yes)
  - [ ] Prerequisites: Triggering at appropriate capability levels? (Target: yes)

#### 5.2: Outcome Distribution Analysis
- [ ] Expected realistic distribution:
  - Extinction: 20-40% (depends on alignment success)
  - Utopia: 20-40% (depends on coordination success)
  - Dystopia: 10-20% (stable oppressive outcome)
  - Inconclusive: 20-40% (didn't reach resolution)
- [ ] **Note:** We don't know what the "right" answer is, but we know 100% of any outcome is wrong

#### 5.3: Sensitivity Analysis
- [ ] Which parameters most affect outcome?
  - Government intervention timing?
  - Organization racing dynamics?
  - Initial alignment distribution?
- [ ] Document findings for researchers

#### 5.4: AI Safety Researcher Review
- [ ] Write up methodology and parameter justifications
- [ ] Can we defend every number with a citation or reasoning?
- [ ] What would Nick Bostrom / Paul Christiano / Eliezer Yudkowsky say about our assumptions?

**Expected Outcome:** Simulation produces defensible, realistic dynamics that can inform AI safety research

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Overcorrection
**Risk:** We increase growth rates too much, every run hits ASI by month 24  
**Mitigation:** Start with conservative increases (2x), validate, then increase if needed

### Risk 2: New Bugs from Parameter Changes
**Risk:** Changing growth rates breaks other systems (NaN errors, infinite loops)  
**Mitigation:** Test each phase independently, run diagnostics before moving to next phase

### Risk 3: Loss of Realism in Different Direction
**Risk:** We fix compute growth but break something else (e.g., economic collapse from too-fast growth)  
**Mitigation:** Cross-validate with multiple sources, not just one paper

### Risk 4: Unclear Parameter Interactions
**Risk:** Changing X affects Y in unexpected ways  
**Mitigation:** Document all changes, log extensively, do sensitivity analysis
