# Black Mirror Phase 1: Immediate Integration (0-3 months)

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 9-12 weeks
**Priority:** HIGH
**Category:** Critical Research-Backed Systems

## Overview

Phase 1 integrates 5 strongly validated systems from Black Mirror analysis that have robust peer-reviewed research backing and clear operationalization paths.

**Approval:** Both super-alignment-researcher AND research-skeptic approved after dialectic review process.

## Systems to Integrate

### 1. Attention Economy System (2-3 weeks)

**Research Backing:**
- Gloria Mark (UC Irvine): 20+ years of attention research
- Average attention span: 47 seconds on screens
- Recovery time: 25 minutes after interruption
- Addiction threshold: 2+ hours daily screen time

**Key Mechanics:**
- Attention depletion pool (replenishes with sleep)
- Fragmentation index (task-switching impact)
- Performance degradation: base * (1 - fragmentation * 0.3)
- Behavioral addiction flags at 2+ hour threshold

**Integration Points:**
- Agent decision quality
- Economic productivity
- Social interaction quality

### 2. Surveillance Normalization System (2-3 weeks)

**Research Backing:**
- Panopticon effect studies (Foucault)
- Elizabeth Stoycheff (2016): 23-35% activity reduction under surveillance
- Privacy normalization research

**Key Mechanics:**
- Surveillance level tracking (0-1)
- Chilling effects (23-35% sensitive activity reduction)
- Normalization ratchet (each expansion easier than last)
- Privacy expectations decay over time

**Integration Points:**
- Civil liberties metrics
- Authoritarian state probability
- Innovation/risk-taking behavior
- Public discourse (self-censorship)

### 3. Notification Addiction System (1.5-2 weeks)

**Research Backing:**
- Neuroscience of variable reward schedules
- Dopamine response curves
- Behavioral addiction markers

**Key Mechanics:**
- Variable reward timing creates stronger addiction
- Anticipation spike > reward delivery
- Checking compulsion (12+ times/hour at high addiction)
- Withdrawal symptoms when unavailable

**Integration Points:**
- Compounds with Attention Economy System
- Safety (distraction lethality)
- Productivity degradation
- Well-being metrics

### 4. Reality Erosion System (2-3 weeks)

**Research Backing:**
- Deepfake growth: 2.5x annually (Sensity AI)
- Detection accuracy: ~45% (MIT, 2024)
- "Liar's dividend" effect (Chesney & Citron, 2019)

**Key Mechanics:**
- Deepfake prevalence tracking (2.5x annual growth)
- Detection accuracy decline over time
- Media trust decay (each scandal: trust *= 0.95)
- Information warfare difficulty reduction

**Integration Points:**
- Information integrity
- Government legitimacy
- Democratic resilience
- Epistemic crisis risk

### 5. Social Rating Mechanics (2-3 weeks)

**Research Backing:**
- China's Social Credit System data (2024)
- Platform rating systems (Uber, Yelp)
- Behavioral compliance research

**Key Mechanics:**
- Context-dependent implementation (voluntary vs state-mandated)
- Government type modulates impact
- Threshold effects (scores below 3.0 trigger ostracism)
- Exit option availability affects resistance

**Integration Points:**
- Authoritarian control effectiveness
- Social cohesion/fragmentation
- Economic mobility
- Civil liberties

## Timeline

**Weeks 1-3:** Attention Economy + Surveillance Normalization
**Weeks 4-6:** Notification Addiction + Reality Erosion
**Weeks 7-9:** Social Rating Mechanics
**Weeks 10-12:** Integration testing and validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Attention spans match Gloria Mark's 47-second finding
- [ ] 25-minute recovery times emerge naturally
- [ ] Addiction emerges at 2+ hour daily threshold
- [ ] Surveillance reduces sensitive activities by 23-35%
- [ ] Normalization ratchet (each expansion easier)
- [ ] Variable reward schedules create stronger addiction
- [ ] Deepfake prevalence grows 2.5x annually
- [ ] Media trust decays with scandals
- [ ] Social rating threshold effects at 3.0 score
