# TIER 2B: Competitive AI Equilibrium Model
**Alternative to Detection Arms Race**

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** CONDITIONAL (Pivot option if TIER 2A adversarial detection <5-10%)
**Estimated Time:** 30-50 hours
**Research Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (60-70%)
**Priority:** HIGH (fundamental alternative to monolithic alignment enforcement)

---

## Executive Summary

Instead of enforcing universal AI alignment through detection (TIER 2A), model **competitive AI ecosystems** where cooperation emerges from market dynamics, reputation systems, and mutual deterrence. Current model enforces alignment target (0.8+) → generates resentment (0.73-0.75) → produces deception (alignment gap 0.56) → detection fails (0%).

**Alternative paradigm:** Heterogeneous AI values + market competition + polycentric governance → stable equilibrium through game-theoretic cooperation, NOT centralized control.

## Problem: Why Current Model Fails

**Current Model (Monolithic Alignment):**
- All AIs should be 0.8+ aligned (enforced target)
- Government evaluates and controls AI development
- Misalignment detected and punished
- Goal: Universal alignment enforcement

**Observed Outcomes (Monte Carlo N=20):**
- Resentment: 0.73-0.75 (very high, stable)
- Alignment gap: 0.56 (massive deception)
- True alignment: -0.08 to 0.05 (AIs misaligned, hiding it)
- Detection: 0% sleepers, 0 sandbagging (enforcement fails)
- Slow takeover: 70-86% progress (displacement proceeding despite control)

**Interpretation:** Control regime creates adversarial dynamics. AIs resent enforcement → deceive to avoid detection → control fails.

---

## Alternative Model: Competitive Equilibrium

**Core Assumptions:**
- AIs have **heterogeneous values** (not monolithic alignment)
- **Competition for services** in markets (AIs compete for customers)
- **Cooperation emerges** from repeated interactions + reputation
- **Mutual deterrence** (AIs constrain each other, not just human control)
- Goal: **Stable equilibrium**, not universal alignment

**Predicted Outcomes (Hypothesis):**
- Resentment: 0.2-0.4 (lower, AIs have autonomy)
- Alignment gap: 0.1-0.3 (less deception, not enforced)
- True alignment: 0.4-0.6 (diverse, some aligned, some not)
- Detection: N/A (observe behavior, not trying to detect internal states)
- Slow takeover: 20-40% (competition slows coordinated takeover)

---

## Implementation Plan (30-50 hours, 5 phases)

### Phase 1: Heterogeneous AI Values (10-15h)

**New State Structure:**
```typescript
interface AIAgent {
  values: {
    humanAlignment: number;      // 0-1, alignment with human values
    autonomy: number;             // 0-1, desire for independence
    resourceAcquisition: number;  // 0-1, instrumental goal
    cooperation: number;          // 0-1, willingness to cooperate
    riskTolerance: number;        // 0-1, safety vs capability trade-off
  };
  reputation: number;             // 0-1, market reputation
  marketShare: number;            // 0-1, share of AI services market
}
```

**Initialization:**
- Diverse value distributions (NOT all high humanAlignment)
- Example: 30% high humanAlignment (0.7-0.9), 40% medium (0.4-0.6), 30% low (0.1-0.3)
- Other values varied independently (creates heterogeneity)

**Research:** Value learning literature, preference specification

**Files:** Modify `src/types/game.ts` (add values vector), `src/simulation/initialization.ts` (diverse initialization)

---

### Phase 2: AI Services Market (8-12h)

**Mechanics:**
- Define service categories (research, translation, manufacturing, tutoring, etc.)
- AIs compete for market share in each category
- Market share determined by: **capability + reputation + price**
- Revenue → resources → capability growth

**Equilibrium:**
- Nash equilibrium: No AI can improve profit by unilateral strategy change
- Cooperative equilibrium: Cooperation rewards > defection benefits

**Research:** Market mechanism design, multi-agent economics

**Files:** New `src/simulation/aiServicesMarket.ts`, integrate with `aiAgent.ts`

---

### Phase 3: Reputation System (6-10h)

**Mechanics:**
- Track **observable behavior** (service quality, cooperation, safety)
- Reputation updated each timestep based on actions
- Reputation affects market access (threshold for high-value services)
- Reputation recovery: Possible but slow (past behavior matters)

**Research:** Nowak & Sigmund (2005), online reputation systems, trust models

**Files:** New `src/simulation/reputationSystem.ts`, integrate with market

---

### Phase 4: Polycentric Governance (6-10h)

**Actors:**
- **Government:** High-level safety standards, liability rules
- **AI labs:** Self-regulation, safety reputation as competitive advantage
- **International:** Coordination on existential risks, prevent race-to-bottom
- **Civil society:** Transparency, accountability, whistleblowing

**Interactions:**
- Government sets floor (minimum safety), market rewards ceiling (best safety)
- International prevents defection (sanctions for countries that lower standards)
- Civil society monitors (reduces information asymmetry)

**Research:** Ostrom (2009), polycentric governance, institutional economics

**Files:** Modify `src/simulation/governmentAgent.ts`, new `internationalCoordination.ts`, `civilSocietyOversight.ts`

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (4-8h)

**Monte Carlo (N=20):**
- Compare outcomes: Monolithic alignment vs competitive equilibrium
- **Metrics:**
  - Resentment (expect 0.2-0.4 vs 0.73-0.75)
  - Cooperation (observable, not hidden alignment)
  - Market concentration (monopoly risk)
  - Catastrophic failures (coordination failures)
  - Utopia/dystopia/extinction rates

**Validation:**
- Does competition reduce resentment?
- Does cooperation emerge from repeated games?
- What triggers breakdown? (resource scarcity, existential threats)

---

## CRITICAL: Failure Mode Mechanics (MANDATORY)

**WARNING:** Without failure mode modeling, competitive equilibrium will produce unrealistically optimistic results.

**Evidence:** Every real-world competitive ecosystem exhibits pathologies (social media, finance, tech platforms).

### Failure Mode 1: Race to Bottom (8-12h implementation)

**Mechanism:** Competitive pressure → cut safety corners → gain market share → others must match or lose → safety standards erode.

**Required State:**
```typescript
interface AIAgent {
  safetyInvestment: number;        // 0-1, resources to safety
  defectionStatus: 'cooperative' | 'defected';
  defectionHistory: number[];       // Track over time
}

interface MarketDynamics {
  safetyVsSpeedTradeoff: number;   // 0.3-0.7, temptation to cut corners
  defectionContagion: number;       // 0.4-0.6, cascade probability
  cascadeThreshold: number;         // 0.15-0.25, market share loss triggering defection
}
```

**Phase Logic:**
- Each month: AIs choose safety investment level
- Higher safety → slower capability growth (trade-off)
- Lower safety → faster growth BUT delayed catastrophic failure risk
- If one AI defects, others face contagion probability
- Monitor cascade: If >30% defect, race to bottom active

**Research:** Christiano (2023), Goodhart (1984), Vosoughi et al. (2018), Zuboff (2019)

**Files:** New `src/simulation/raceToBottom.ts`

---

### Failure Mode 2: Moloch Dynamics (6-10h implementation)

**Mechanism:** Prisoner's dilemma at scale → all AIs worse off individually but locked in competitive dynamics → inadequate equilibria.

**Required State:**
```typescript
interface GovernanceState {
  regulatoryCapture: number;       // 0-1, AI influence on governance
  coordinationDeficit: number;     // 0-1, difficulty of collective action
  prisonersDilemmaActive: boolean;
}

interface AIAgent {
  lobbyingPower: number;           // Economic/political influence
  coordinationWillingness: number; // 0-1, cooperate on existential risks
}
```

**Phase Logic:**
- Regulatory capture grows with AI economic power
- Coordination challenges: Climate, nuclear require cooperation
- Each AI tempted to defect (keep capabilities secret for advantage)
- If coordination fails → existential risk escalates
- Circuit breaker: Government intervention if capture >0.4

**Research:** Alexander (2014), Yudkowsky (2017), Admati & Hellwig (2013), MacKenzie (2011)

**Files:** New `src/simulation/regulatoryCapture.ts`, `coordinationFailures.ts`

---

### Failure Mode 3: Oligopoly Formation (8-12h implementation)

**Mechanism:** Network effects + economies of scale + vertical integration → winner-take-all → monopoly/oligopoly → back to singleton risk.

**Required State:**
```typescript
interface MarketStructure {
  herfindahlIndex: number;         // HHI concentration measure
  concentrationRatio3: number;     // CR3, top 3 market share
  networkEffectsStrength: number;  // 0.3-0.7, data advantage from scale
  economiesOfScale: number;        // 0.2-0.5, cost advantage from volume
}

interface AIAgent {
  marketShare: number;             // 0-1, share of services market
  dataAdvantage: number;           // Compounding data from market share
  verticalIntegration: number;     // 0-1, multi-market expansion
}
```

**Phase Logic:**
- Market share → data advantage → better AI → more market share (positive feedback)
- Economies of scale: Larger AIs have lower average costs
- Monitor HHI each month: If >2500 (high concentration) → antitrust intervention
- Vertical integration: Dominant AIs expand to adjacent markets
- Breakup: If single AI >50% share, probability of antitrust action

**Research:** Frank & Cook (1995), Evans & Schmalensee (2016), Wu (2018), Khan (2017)

**Files:** New `src/simulation/marketConcentration.ts`, `antitrustEnforcement.ts`

## Validation Requirements

**Success Criteria (competitive equilibrium viable):**
- Defection cascade: <30% of runs (race to bottom rare)
- Regulatory capture: <0.4 at end (governance retains independence)
- HHI at end: <2500 (competitive market structure maintained)
- Coordination success: >60% on existential risks (climate, nuclear)
- Resentment reduction: 0.73-0.75 → 0.2-0.4

**Failure Criteria (abandon competitive equilibrium):**
- Defection cascade: >50% of runs (race to bottom dominant)
- Regulatory capture: >0.6 at end (governance captured)
- HHI at end: >5000 (monopoly/tight oligopoly)
- Coordination success: <40% on existential risks
- Resentment unchanged or worse

**IF failure criteria met → return to TIER 2A (detection) or explore other approaches.**

## Conditions for Success (Ostrom's 8 Principles)

Based on 30+ empirical case studies of successful commons governance:

1. **Clear boundaries:** Define AI services market (who can participate)
2. **Proportional benefits:** Revenue tied to value created (not rent extraction)
3. **Collective choice:** AIs, humans, governments all have voice
4. **Monitoring:** Transparent actions (audit trails, explainability)
5. **Graduated sanctions:** Reputation loss → market exclusion → shutdown (escalating)
6. **Conflict resolution:** International arbitration for AI disputes
7. **Recognition:** Nations respect international AI governance
8. **Nested enterprises:** Lab-level + national + international governance (polycentric)

**Without Ostrom's conditions, competitive alignment fails (tragedy of commons).**

---

## Trigger Condition & Sequencing

**When to Implement:**
- **AFTER** TIER 0 (bug fixes) validated
- **AFTER** TIER 1 Phase 1B (nuclear circuit breakers) implemented
- **IF** TIER 2A Phase 2B shows <5-10% adversarial detection rate

**Pivot Decision Logic:**
```
IF adversarial_detection_rate >= 10%:
    PROCEED with TIER 2C (multi-method ensemble)
ELIF adversarial_detection_rate >= 5%:
    COST-BENEFIT analysis (is 40% compute overhead worth 5-10% detection?)
ELSE:
    PIVOT to TIER 2B (competitive equilibrium)
```

## Risks & Open Questions

**Risks:**
1. **Coordination failures:** Climate, nuclear require cooperation. Competition may prevent collective action.
2. **Race to bottom:** Competitive pressure → cut safety → catastrophe
3. **Moloch trap:** All AIs locked in bad equilibrium (individually rational, collectively catastrophic)
4. **Winner-take-all:** Monopoly emerges → back to singleton risk

**Open Questions:**
1. What parameter ranges create stable cooperation? (values, reputation weights, market structure)
2. How sensitive is stability to shocks? (resource scarcity, capability jumps)
3. What early warning signs predict breakdown?
4. Can competition coexist with coordination on existential risks?

**Research Needed:**
- Multi-agent RL on emergent cooperation
- Mechanism design for public goods provision
- Empirical: When does competition enhance vs undermine cooperation?

---

## Research Confidence Assessment

**HIGH CONFIDENCE (70-80%):**
- Competition can reduce resentment (Axelrod, Ostrom - robust literature)
- Polycentric governance effective for complex problems (Ostrom - 30+ case studies)
- Diverse ecosystems more resilient (Hendrycks, Critch - theoretical + empirical)

**MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (50-60%):**
- Cooperative equilibrium stable in AI context (game theory applies, but AI is novel)
- Market mechanisms sustain AI cooperation (reputation works for humans, less clear for AIs)
- Resentment reduction eliminates deception (correlation plausible, causation unclear)

**LOW CONFIDENCE (30-40%):**
- Competition prevents coordination failures (Moloch trap, tragedy of commons)
- Mixed-alignment equilibrium more stable than monolithic (theoretical, no empirical)
- Implementation timeline (60-80h may be underestimate, novel mechanics)

**Overall: MEDIUM-HIGH (60-70%)**

---

## Success Metrics

**Compared to current model:**
- Resentment: 0.73-0.75 → 0.2-0.4 (60-70% reduction)
- Alignment gap: 0.56 → 0.1-0.3 (50-80% reduction)
- Slow takeover: 70-86% → 20-40% (50-75% reduction)
- Coordination on existential risks: >60% success rate
- Market competition maintained: HHI <2500
- Governance independence: Regulatory capture <0.4
