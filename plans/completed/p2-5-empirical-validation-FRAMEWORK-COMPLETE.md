# P2.5: Empirical Validation Against Historical Data

**Status:** Framework Complete (Oct 16, 2025) - Awaiting Simulation Features
**Time Spent:** ~4 hours (framework implementation)
**Remaining:** 2-4 hours (once simulation features available)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Critical Fix - Validation

## Overview

Prove simulation can reproduce known historical events to establish credibility.

## Goal

Validate simulation against 3 major historical events with well-documented outcomes.

## ✅ Completed (Oct 16, 2025)

### Framework Implementation

**Created Files:**
- ✅ `/tests/validation/historicalStates.ts` - Historical state initialization (COVID-19, 2008, Black Death)
- ✅ `/tests/validation/covid19.test.ts` - 6 validation tests
- ✅ `/tests/validation/crisis2008.test.ts` - 7 validation tests
- ✅ `/tests/validation/blackdeath.test.ts` - 7 validation tests
- ✅ `/tests/validation/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

**Key Features:**
- Historical state initialization functions with research-backed parameters
- 20 total validation tests covering all three scenarios
- Validation metrics extraction utilities
- Comprehensive documentation with sources

### Test Coverage

**COVID-19 (6 tests):**
- Mortality within 0.1-0.25% range
- Tech sector revenue growth +20-40%
- Economic recovery timeline 18-24mo
- Vaccine development 12-18mo
- Organizational survival >90%
- Remote work adoption 30-50%

**2008 Financial Crisis (7 tests):**
- Organizational survival 70-90%
- Economic recovery 24-48mo
- Unemployment spike 5% → 10%
- Government bailout response
- Tech sector resilience
- Wealth inequality increase
- NO extinction/dystopia outcome

**Black Death (7 tests):**
- 30-60% mortality during plague
- NO extinction despite 50% mortality
- Population recovery over 100 years
- Wage increases from labor scarcity
- Feudal system weakening
- Institutional resilience
- Accelerated cultural change

## ⏸️ Blocked (Awaiting Simulation Features)

All tests are currently `test.skip()` because they require simulation features:

### Required Features

1. **Event Trigger System**
   - Pandemic events with configurable mortality/duration
   - Economic crisis events with configurable severity
   - Medieval pandemic parameters

2. **Organizational Bankruptcy Realism**
   - Current: 100% bankruptcy during crises (unrealistic)
   - Needed: 10-30% bankruptcy, sector-dependent resilience
   - Tech companies should be more resilient

3. **Recovery Tracking**
   - Economic stage history
   - Population growth tracking
   - Time-series analysis utilities
   - Time-to-recovery metrics

4. **Long-Term Simulation Support**
   - Black Death test needs 100-year (1200-month) runs
   - Performance optimization for extended timescales

## Key Insights Documented

### 1. Organizational Bankruptcy Realism

**Current Issue:** Simulation shows 100% organizational bankruptcy during economic crises (seen in Monte Carlo logs).

**Historical Reality:**
- 2008 crisis: 85% S&P 500 survival, 95% tech survival
- COVID-19: >90% large organization survival
- Real crises cause ~10-30% bankruptcy, not total collapse

**Required Fix:** Calibrate bankruptcy mechanics to match historical resilience. This is likely causing simulation to appear overly pessimistic.

### 2. High Mortality ≠ Extinction

**Critical Principle:** 50% mortality is catastrophic but NOT extinction.

**Historical Evidence:**
- Black Death: 50% European mortality, full recovery in 100 years
- Justinian Plague: 30-50% mortality, recovery
- Pattern: Humans survive and recover from extreme events

**Required Fix:** Recalibrate extinction thresholds. The simulation needs to model resilience, not just catastrophe.

### 3. Crises Enable Change

**Historical Pattern:**
- Black Death → Renaissance (labor scarcity → higher wages → opportunity)
- 2008 Crisis → Fintech boom (regulatory reform → innovation)
- COVID-19 → Remote work revolution (forced adaptation → new normal)

**Opportunity:** Model how crises can catalyze positive change, not just deterioration. This aligns with upward spiral mechanics.

## Success Criteria

When simulation features are implemented:

- [ ] COVID-19: Matches mortality (<0.3%), tech growth (+20-40%), recovery (18-24mo)
- [ ] 2008 Crisis: Organizational survival 70-90%, recovery by 48mo, tech resilient
- [ ] Black Death: 30-60% mortality, full recovery within 120yr, NO extinction

**All tests must pass with ZERO parameter tuning.** Tests represent historical reality. If they fail, the simulation needs fixing, not the test expectations.

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Implement Simulation Features (Est: 4-6h)

1. **Event Trigger System** (2h)
   - Create `triggerPandemic(mortality, duration)` function
   - Create `triggerEconomicCrisis(severity, duration)` function
   - Add to simulation engine or test utilities

2. **Fix Organizational Bankruptcy** (2h)
   - Review current bankruptcy logic (likely in `organizationPhase`)
   - Add sector-based resilience (tech 95%, finance 70%, general 85%)
   - Calibrate to ~10-30% bankruptcy under crisis (not 100%)

3. **Add Recovery Tracking** (1-2h)
   - Store economic stage history
   - Store population history (already exists?)
   - Add time-to-recovery utility functions

### Phase 2: Run Validation (Est: 1-2h)

1. Remove all `test.skip()` from validation tests
2. Run full suite: `npm test tests/validation`
3. Document pass/fail for each test
4. Create validation report

### Phase 3: Iterate Until Pass (Est: Variable)

For each failing test:
1. Analyze why simulation diverges from history
2. Review research on the historical event
3. **Adjust simulation mechanics** (NOT test expectations)
4. Re-run validation

Repeat until all tests pass.

- Institutional continuity studies: Church, kingdoms, trade

## Impact

**Value of This Work:**

1. **Credibility:** Proves simulation can reproduce known outcomes
2. **Calibration:** Identifies unrealistic behaviors (e.g., 100% bankruptcy)
3. **Resilience:** Validates that simulation models recovery, not just catastrophe
4. **Research-Backed:** Uses historical data, not arbitrary expectations

**Publications:** Once tests pass, this validates simulation for research use. "Our model reproduces COVID-19, 2008, and Black Death outcomes" is a strong credibility claim.

## Integration

This validation suite complements:
- **Phase 1-2 Tests:** Unit/integration tests for mechanics
- **P2.3 Tests:** Population segment mechanics
- **Validation Tests:** End-to-end historical validation

Together: Multi-level validation from unit → integration → historical.

## Philosophy

**Research-Backed Realism:** These tests embody the project philosophy.

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

If a test fails, we investigate *why the simulation diverges from reality*, not why the test is "too hard." Historical events are ground truth.
