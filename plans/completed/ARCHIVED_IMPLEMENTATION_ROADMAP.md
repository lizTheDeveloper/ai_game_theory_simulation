## Philosophy: Research-Backed Realism

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Research First:** Every mechanic backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research
2. **Mechanisms Over Balance:** Set parameters to real-world values, don't tune for "fun"
3. **Emergence:** Allow unexpected outcomes to emerge from interactions
4. **Documentation:** Every system has research citations

# TIER 0: Baseline Corrections

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Completion Date:** October 11, 2025
**Branch:** `tier2-major-mitigations` → MERGED TO MAIN

## 0.1 2025 Starting Parameter Corrections

**Why Critical:**
- Original starting conditions unrealistically optimistic
- Earth already in overshoot, not pristine condition
- 7/9 planetary boundaries already breached (Rockström et al. 2023, Richardson et al. 2024)
- Starting "safe" made existential risks invisible

**What Changed:**

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Source |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Biodiversity | 70% | 35% | IPBES 2024: 1M species threatened |
| Resources | 85% | 65% | Earth Overshoot Day: July 29 (1.7x overconsumption) |
| Pollution | 15% | 30% | Novel Entities boundary breached |
| Climate rate | 0.48%/month | 0.08%/month | IPCC AR6: 1.1°C in 150 years |
| Meaning crisis | 15% | 22% | WHO 2025: Anxiety/depression epidemic |

**Impact:**
- Simulation starts from realistic 2025 conditions
- All planetary boundaries reflect actual research
- Climate timeline matches IPCC projections
- Makes crises visible from game start

**Research Backing:**
- **IPBES (2024):** Global Assessment on Biodiversity
- **Global Footprint Network (2024):** Earth Overshoot Day
- **IPCC AR6 (2023):** Physical Science Basis
- **WHO (2025):** Mental Health Atlas
- **Stockholm Resilience Centre (2023-2024):** Planetary Boundaries updates

**File:** `src/simulation/resources.ts` (lines 85-160, 410-480)
**Dev Time:** ~4 hours (actual)
**Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Why Critical:**
- Phosphorus essential for food (no substitutes)

- Peak Phosphorus expected 2030-2040
- 24-month pathway to global famine

**Implementation:**

1. **Resource Depletion System** (lines 85-120)
   - Monthly consumption: 4.5M tons (54M tons/year)
   - Reserves: 70B tons (140 years at current rate)
   - Depletion accelerates with population growth
   - No recycling initially (closed-loop systems unlock later)

2. **Supply Shock Mechanics** (lines 121-145)
   - Morocco monopoly: 70% of reserves
   - Trigger: Geopolitical crisis or resource nationalism
   - Effects: Price spike (10x), hoarding, trade disruption
   - Duration: 6-18 months

3. **Famine Cascade** (lines 146-160)
   - Fertilizer shortage → crop failure (12-24 month lag)
   - Food scarcity → mass mortality
   - Regional famines → refugee crises
   - Death rate: 1-5% global population

4. **Integration Points**
   - Resource economy: Phosphorus tracking alongside traditional resources
   - Crisis system: Supply shock triggers government response

```
🌲 AMAZON TIPPING POINT CROSSED (Month 54)
🪸 CORAL REEF TIPPING POINT CROSSED (Month 90)
💀 GLOBAL CRISIS DEATHS: 350.7M casualties (Ecosystem collapse)
```

## Surprises & Discoveries:

1. **Country System Reuse (TIER 1.7.2):** Saved 18-23 hours on TIER 2.8 by extending existing countries
2. **Government Environmental Gap:** Governments had ZERO environmental actions (critical gap)
3. **Tipping Point Cascades:** Non-linear interactions more severe than expected
4. **Sleeper Detection:** Simple probes effective (Anthropic 2025 validated our approach)
5. **Energy Constraints:** Realistic threshold already approaching (2024: 17% utilization)

## Technical Debt Identified:

1. **Aerosol Boundary:** Simple model, needs improvement (boundary #9)
2. **Regional Dynamics:** 7 regions simplified, could be more granular
3. **Economic Complexity:** GDP scaling simplified, more detailed possible
4. **Technology Tree:** Foundation exists, needs explicit dependency graph (TIER 4.1)
5. **Dystopia Variants:** Generic dystopia, needs flavor variants (TIER 4.2)

# Next Steps (See Active Roadmap)

**Pending Implementation:**
- TIER 2.8: Colonial Extraction & Military Power (33-42 hours estimated)
- TIER 4.1: Technology Tree System (8 hours)
- TIER 4.2: Dystopia Variant Paths (6 hours)
- TIER 4.6: Human Enhancement & Merger (7 hours)
- TIER 5: Advanced features (46 hours total)

# Acknowledgments

This implementation was a collaborative effort between:
- **User (Ann):** Vision, research direction, philosophical grounding, "let the model show what it shows"
- **Claude (AI Assistant):** Implementation, research synthesis, technical architecture, testing

**Philosophy:** "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can."

**Result:** A simulation grounded in 100+ research papers, modeling AI alignment as an Earth system problem, with realistic crises and research-backed mitigations.
