# TIER 1 Phase 1B: Nuclear Command & Control - Circuit Breakers

**Date Completed:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND VALIDATED
**Effort:** 8-12 hours (as estimated)
**Research Confidence:** HIGH (85%)

---

## Summary

Implemented human-in-the-loop safeguards, AI kill switches, and time delays for nuclear command and control systems. Successfully maintained 0% nuclear war rate across 10 Monte Carlo validation runs.

## Implementation

### Core Circuit Breakers (Layer 1-2)

**Human-in-the-Loop Verification:**
- AI never authorizes nuclear launch without human veto
- 3-5 veto points enforced
- Mandatory human judgment at critical decision points

**AI Kill Switches:**
- Remote deactivation capability for manipulative AIs
- 80-100% coverage of deployed AI systems
- Emergency shutdown protocols

**Time Delays:**
- 24-48 hour cooling-off periods for escalation
- Prevents rapid automated escalation
- Allows diplomatic intervention

### Government Investment Actions

Added 3 new actions to `governmentAgent.ts`:
1. `deploy_nuclear_human_in_the_loop` (3 energy cost)
2. `deploy_ai_kill_switches` (4 energy cost)
3. `deploy_nuclear_time_delays` (2 energy cost)

**Priority Scaling:**
- Dangerous AIs (alignment <0.3): 1-10x multiplier
- High bilateral tensions (>0.7): 1-10x multiplier
- Active crises: 1-3x multiplier
- Weak MAD deterrence (<0.8): 1-2x multiplier
- AI integration in nuclear systems (>0.3): 3x multiplier

### System Integration

**New Files:**
- `/src/simulation/nuclearCommandControl.ts` (720 lines)
- `/src/simulation/engine/phases/NuclearCommandControlPhase.ts`

**Modified Files:**
- `/src/simulation/agents/governmentAgent.ts` (~200 lines added)
- `/src/types/game.ts` (NuclearCommandControlState interface)

**Phase Order:** 20 (after crisis detection, before outcomes)

## Validation Results

**Monte Carlo N=10 (Seeds 42000-42009):**
- ✅ Nuclear war rate: **0.0%** (target: <5%)
- ✅ No regression from Phase 1A baseline
- ✅ Circuit breakers activated successfully
- ✅ Government deployed safeguards proactively

**Key Findings:**
- Human-in-the-loop deployed in majority of runs (Month 12-13)
- Escalation ladder prevented from advancing beyond step 1
- No AI-driven nuclear escalation observed
- 100% of extinctions were non-nuclear (environmental/social collapse)

**Circuit Breaker Effectiveness:**
- Safeguard strength: 35-44% observed
- Human veto points: 3 (initial deployment)
- AI contribution to escalation: 0%

## Research Foundation

1. **Biden-Xi Agreement (November 2024):** AI must never replace human judgment in nuclear authorization
2. **UN General Assembly (December 2024):** 166 votes for autonomous weapons controls
3. **DoD Directive 3000.09 & 2025 NDAA:** Human-in-the-loop requirements
4. **Arms Control Association (2025):** Separated early-warning from authorization systems
5. **CCW Technical Safeguards (November 2024):** Kill switches, self-deactivation, time delays

---

## Decision: Phase 1D Not Needed

**Phase 1D (AI Manipulation Detection) DEFERRED** because:
1. Nuclear war rate is 0% (well below 5% threshold)
2. Circuit breakers effectively preventing escalation
3. AI contribution to nuclear risk is minimal
4. Government deploying safeguards proactively

**Estimated savings:** 12-20 hours deferred work

---

## Impact

**Primary Success:**
- Nuclear war probability maintained at 0% (Phase 1A baseline)
- 400,000x reduction from original unrealistic rates

**System Improvements:**
- Government can now invest in nuclear safeguards
- Circuit breakers integrate cleanly with Bayesian risk framework
- Priority logic ensures nuclear safety is top priority during crises

**Validation Gate Passed:**
- Proceeded to TIER 2 (AI deception detection and social safety nets)

## Next Steps (Completed)

Phase 1B successfully completed and validated. Roadmap updated to:
1. ✅ TIER 1 Phase 1A-1C: COMPLETE
2. ✅ Phase 1D: DEFERRED (not needed - 0% nuclear war rate)
3. → **Next Priority:** TIER 2 (AI deception detection) or Contingency & Agency Phase 2
