## üîç KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS

### **1. MORTALITY RATES BY DISPLACEMENT STATUS**

#### **Transit Mortality (Fleeing Active Crisis)**
- **Mediterranean route (2024):** 1 in 120 die (0.83%)
  - 2,452 deaths out of ~294,240 attempts
  - Central Mediterranean (North Africa ‚Üí Italy): Deadliest route, 73% of deaths
  - **2024 was deadliest year on record** (8,938 global migrant deaths)

- **Global migration routes:** ~0.007% annual mortality during transit
  - 8,938 deaths / 123.2M displaced = baseline transit risk
  - BUT: Varies drastically by route danger

- **War zone exodus (Sudan example):**
  - 62,000-150,000 deaths / 12M displaced = 0.5-1.25% mortality
  - Leading cause: Preventable disease + starvation, not direct violence

#### **Refugee Camp Mortality (Settled)**
- **UNHCR camps (2022):** 0.24 per 1,000 per month = **0.29% annual**
  - 172 camps, 5M+ refugees, 21 countries
  - Emergency threshold: <0.3 per 1,000/month = "under control"
  - Well-managed camps have mortality near baseline

#### **Famine Zone Mortality (Unsettled)**
- **Somalia drought (2022):** 43,000 deaths (50% children under 5)
- **Somalia drought (2022-2024):** 71,000 total deaths
  - 71,000 / 2.9M displaced = **2.45% mortality**
  - Children under 5: >50% of deaths (extreme vulnerability)

- **Yemen (ongoing):** ~18.2M need aid, 4.5M displaced
  - 258 cholera deaths out of 95,000 cases
  - Famine conditions, very high child mortality

#### **Stranded/No Resettlement Mortality**
- **Estimated:** 1-3% annual mortality
  - Higher than camps, lower than active famine
  - No medical care, limited food, exposure

### **2. CLIMATE REFUGEE PROJECTIONS BY REGION (2050)**

**Source:** World Bank Groundswell Report + IOM

#### **Regional Breakdown:**
| Region | Internal Displacement (2050) | Percentage |
|--------|------------------------------|------------|
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 86M | 39.8% |
| East Asia & Pacific | 49M | 22.7% |
| South Asia | 40M | 18.5% |
| North Africa | 19M | 8.8% |
| Latin America | 17M | 7.9% |
| E. Europe / Central Asia | 5M | 2.3% |
| **TOTAL** | **216M** | **100%** |

**Note:** These are INTERNAL displacements (within countries). Cross-border flows would add significantly more.

#### **Aggressive Projections:**
- **IPCC:** >1 billion exposed to coastal hazards by 2050
  - Tens to hundreds of millions displaced
- **Some estimates:** 1.2 billion climate refugees by 2050 (includes cross-border)

#### **Timeline:**
- **2030:** Climate migration hotspots begin emerging
- **2050:** 216M internal + unknown cross-border

#### **Mitigation Potential:**
- **80% reduction possible** with early climate action + inclusive development
- Without action: 216M displaced
- With action: ~43M displaced (saving 173M from displacement)

### **3. WAR/CONFLICT DISPLACEMENT PATTERNS (2024)**

#### **Sudan (Largest internal displacement crisis)**
- **Displaced:** 12M (9M internal + 3M cross-border)
- **Mortality:** 62,000-150,000 deaths (estimates vary)
  - Khartoum alone: 26,000 deaths from intentional injury
  - Leading cause: Preventable disease + starvation
- **Duration:** 20+ months (April 2023 - present)
- **Health crises:** 60,000 cholera cases, 1,600 cholera deaths
- **Famine:** Spread to 5 areas, 5 more by May 2025

#### **Syria (Longest-running crisis)**
- **Displaced:** 13M (7.4M internal + 6M refugees)
- **Mortality:** 580,000+ deaths (minimum, as of Dec 2022)
- **Duration:** 13 years (2011-present)
- **Humanitarian needs:** 16.7M people need aid (2024)
- **Food insecurity:** 13M facing acute food insecurity
- **Children:** 650,000 under age 5 stunted from malnutrition

#### **Yemen**
- **Displaced:** 4.5M (mostly internal, hard to exit)
- **Humanitarian needs:** 18.2M people
- **Children:** 11M need aid, 3.1M internally displaced
- **Deaths:** 11,200+ children killed or maimed
- **Famine:** Tens of thousands in famine-like conditions, 5M acute food insecurity

### **4. CARRYING CAPACITY & HOST REGION LIMITS**

#### **Regional Absorption Capacity:**
No specific data found on host region "carrying capacity," but key factors:

1. **Economic capacity:** GDP per capita, job availability
2. **Infrastructure capacity:** Housing, healthcare, schools
3. **Social cohesion:** Cultural similarity, existing diaspora
4. **Political will:** Border policies, resettlement programs
5. **Geography:** Physical space, climate suitability

#### **Anecdotal Evidence:**
- **Jordan:** Hosts 1.3M Syrian refugees (population 10M) = 13% refugee burden
  - Severe strain on infrastructure, water resources
- **Lebanon:** Hosts 1.5M Syrian refugees (population 5.5M) = 27% refugee burden
  - Economic collapse, infrastructure breakdown
- **Turkey:** Hosts 3.6M Syrian refugees (population 85M) = 4.2% refugee burden
  - Manageable but growing political backlash

**Threshold hypothesis:**
- **<5% refugees:** Manageable with adequate infrastructure
- **5-10%:** Strain begins, social tension rises
- **10-20%:** Severe strain, political backlash likely
- **>20%:** Infrastructure collapse, host crisis

## üìä MORTALITY RATE HIERARCHY (Summary)

| Status | Annual Mortality | Monthly | Details |
|--------|------------------|---------|---------|
| **Transit (dangerous route)** | 0.83% | 0.069% | Mediterranean 2024 |
| **Transit (global avg)** | 0.007% | 0.0006% | Most routes safer |
| **Refugee camps (settled)** | 0.29% | 0.024% | UNHCR managed |
| **Stranded (no resettlement)** | 1-3% | 0.08-0.25% | Estimated |
| **War zone (active conflict)** | 0.5-1.25% | 0.04-0.1% | Sudan example |
| **Famine zone** | 2-5%+ | 0.17-0.42%+ | Somalia, high child mortality |
| **Baseline (developed)** | ~0.7% | 0.058% | Normal death rate |
| **Baseline (developing)** | ~1.0% | 0.083% | Normal death rate |

**Key Insight:** Refugees in managed camps (~0.29%) have LOWER mortality than baseline developing country rates (~1.0%), but higher than developed (~0.7%).

**The killer is being stranded or in active famine zones** (2-5% mortality).

## üîÑ REFUGEE FLOW PATTERNS (Regional Dynamics)

### **Primary Flow Pattern: Proximity + Capacity**

Refugees flee to:
1. **Nearest safe area** (geographic proximity) - 60%
2. **Existing diaspora communities** (cultural ties) - 20%
3. **Economic opportunity** (if route accessible) - 15%
4. **No choice** (stranded in transit) - 5%

### **Major Migration Routes (2024-2025):**

#### **1. Mediterranean Route (Deadliest)**
- **Source:** North Africa (Libya, Tunisia, Algeria)
- **Transit:** Mediterranean Sea
- **Destination:** Italy, Malta, Greece
- **Volume:** ~300,000 attempts/year
- **Mortality:** 0.83% (2,452 deaths in 2024)
- **Status:** Militarized borders, increasing deterrence

#### **2. Sub-Saharan ‚Üí North Africa ‚Üí Europe**
- **Source:** Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Sudan
- **Transit:** Sahara Desert ‚Üí Libya/Tunisia
- **Destination:** Europe via Mediterranean
- **Volume:** Unknown (many die in Sahara, undocumented)
- **Mortality:** Very high (desert + sea)

#### **3. Middle East ‚Üí Europe**
- **Source:** Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan
- **Transit:** Turkey ‚Üí Balkans OR Turkey ‚Üí Greece by sea
- **Destination:** Germany, Sweden, Austria
- **Volume:** Peaked 2015 (~1M), now ~100K/year
- **Mortality:** Lower (land route safer than sea)

#### **4. South Asia Internal**
- **Source:** Bangladesh, coastal India
- **Destination:** Inland India, Nepal
- **Volume:** Will be massive (40M projected by 2050)
- **Mortality:** Lower (internal, no sea crossing)
- **Political tension:** India-Bangladesh border militarized

#### **5. Central America ‚Üí US**
- **Source:** Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador
- **Transit:** Mexico
- **Destination:** United States
- **Volume:** ~2M encounters/year at US border
- **Mortality:** Rio Grande drownings, desert deaths

## üíÄ DO REFUGEES DIE IF THEY DON'T RESETTLE?

**YES** - The research shows refugees who remain displaced long-term face elevated mortality:

### **Mortality by Resettlement Status:**

1. **Resettled (camps):** 0.29% annual mortality
   - Near baseline, manageable
   - Medical care, food, shelter provided
   - **Can survive indefinitely** in camps (Syria refugees in Jordan for 13+ years)

2. **Stranded (no camp access):** 1-3% annual mortality
   - No medical care, limited food
   - Exposure, disease, violence
   - **Will die over time** without resettlement

3. **Famine zones (crisis):** 2-5%+ annual mortality
   - Active starvation, disease outbreaks
   - Children die first (>50% of deaths)
   - **Rapid die-off** within months to years

### **Key Mechanisms of Death (Displaced Populations):**

1. **Disease** (Leading cause in war zones like Sudan)
   - Cholera, measles, malaria, typhoid
   - No vaccination, no sanitation
   - Spreads rapidly in crowded conditions

2. **Starvation** (Famine zones)
   - Children under 5 most vulnerable
   - Leads to disease susceptibility
   - Slow death over months

3. **Exposure** (Stranded populations)
   - Heat stress, hypothermia
   - No shelter

4. **Violence** (Surprisingly lower than expected)
   - Only 26,000 / 62,000 Sudan deaths from "intentional injury"
   - Most die from disease/starvation, not violence

5. **Transit mortality** (Dangerous routes)
   - Drowning (Mediterranean, Rio Grande)
   - Desert crossing (Sahara, Arizona)
   - Smuggler violence, exploitation

### **Long-Term Survival:**

- **With resettlement (camps):** Can survive decades (Syrian crisis: 13 years and counting)
- **Without resettlement (stranded):** Die off at 1-3% per year
  - After 10 years: 10-30% dead
  - After 20 years: 20-60% dead
  - After 50 years: Extinction (if no resettlement)

**Conclusion:** Refugees DIE without resettlement, but it's a slow death (1-5%/year), not instant. The real killer is being **stranded in active crisis zones** (famine, war, no camps).

## üéØ IMPLICATIONS FOR SIMULATION DESIGN

### **1. Regional Population Tracking Required**

To model refugees realistically, we need **at minimum 6 regional populations**:

1. **Sub-Saharan Africa** (1.4B)
2. **North Africa & Middle East** (600M)
3. **South Asia** (1.9B)
4. **East Asia & Pacific** (2.3B)
5. **Europe & Central Asia** (900M)
6. **Americas** (1.0B)

**Why:** Climate vulnerability, carrying capacity, and flow patterns are region-specific.

### **2. Crisis-Specific Displacement Rates**

| Crisis Type | Displacement Rate | Mortality (Displaced) | Mortality (Stayed) |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Climate (slow)** | 5-10% displaced | 0.5-1% annual | 1-2% (if stayed) |
| **Climate (rapid)** | 30-50% displaced | 1-2% annual | 5-10% (if stayed) |
| **War (regional)** | 20-40% displaced | 0.5-1.25% annual | 2-5% (war zone) |
| **Nuclear war** | 50-70% displaced | 2-5% annual | 50% instant death |
| **Famine** | 10-30% displaced | 2-5% annual | 5-15% (if stayed) |
| **Ecosystem collapse** | 5-15% displaced | 0.5-1% annual | 1-3% (slow poison) |

**Note:** Staying in crisis zone is often MORE dangerous than fleeing.

### **3. Resettlement Capacity by Region**

Based on current burdens:

| Region | Population | Estimated Capacity | Current Burden |
|--------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Europe** | 900M | 5-10M (0.5-1%) | 6M (0.67%) |
| **North America** | 500M | 5-10M (1-2%) | 2M (0.4%) |
| **Gulf States** | 60M | 1-2M (1.7-3%) | 1M (1.67%) |
| **Sub-Saharan Africa** | 1.4B | 10-20M (0.7-1.4%) | 12M (0.86%) |
| **South Asia** | 1.9B | 10-20M (0.5-1%) | 5M (0.26%) |
| **East Asia** | 2.3B | 10-20M (0.4-0.9%) | 3M (0.13%) |

**Threshold for severe strain:** >1% of population as refugees

### **4. Mortality Rates for Simulation**

```typescript
export interface RefugeeDeathRates {
  // Monthly mortality rates [0, 1]
  inTransit: {
    dangerous: 0.00069,  // 0.83% annual (Mediterranean)
    safe: 0.00006,       // 0.007% annual (global avg)
  };

  resettled: {
    camp: 0.00024,       // 0.29% annual (UNHCR camps)
    integrated: 0.00058, // 0.7% annual (developed country baseline)
  };

  stranded: {
    minimal: 0.00083,    // 1% annual (no camp, but stable area)
    moderate: 0.00208,   // 2.5% annual (no services)
    severe: 0.00417,     // 5% annual (active crisis)
  };

  crisisZone: {
    war: 0.00208,        // 2.5% annual (like Sudan)
    famine: 0.00417,     // 5% annual (Somalia drought)
    genocide: 0.01667,   // 20% annual (active killing)
  };
}
```

### **5. Regional Refugee Flow Example**

**Scenario: Bangladesh Climate Collapse (2040)**

1. **Trigger:** Sea level rise + cyclones ‚Üí 30% of Bangladesh uninhabitable
2. **Population affected:** 170M √ó 30% = 51M need to relocate
3. **Displacement destinations:**
   - **Internal (India):** 35M (geographic proximity, but tense border)
   - **Middle East:** 10M (existing diaspora, economic opportunity)
   - **Southeast Asia:** 3M (geographic proximity)
   - **Europe:** 2M (via dangerous routes)
   - **Stranded:** 1M (can't afford to leave)

4. **Mortality:**
   - **Transit (India land border):** 35M √ó 0.00006 √ó 6 months = 12,600 deaths
   - **Transit (sea to ME):** 10M √ó 0.00069 √ó 3 months = 20,700 deaths
   - **Stranded (climate zone):** 1M √ó 0.00417 √ó 12 months = 50,040 deaths
   - **Total first year:** ~83,000 deaths (0.16% of displaced)

5. **Host region impacts:**
   - **India:** +35M refugees (population 1.9B) = +1.8% strain
     - Infrastructure strain: HIGH
     - Social tension: VERY HIGH (already tense border)
     - Border militarization: CERTAIN
   - **Middle East:** +10M (population 400M) = +2.5% strain
     - Economic strain: MODERATE (rich countries)
     - Cultural integration: MODERATE (existing diaspora)

6. **Long-term (10 years):**
   - **Resettled in camps:** 30M survive, 0.29% annual mortality
   - **Stranded:** 1M ‚Üí 700K (30% dead from 1-3% annual rate)

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED SIMULATION APPROACH

### **Phase 1: Basic Regional System (Implement Now)**

**6 Regional Populations:**
1. Sub-Saharan Africa
2. North Africa & Middle East
3. South Asia
4. East Asia & Pacific
5. Europe & Central Asia
6. Americas

**Each region tracks:**
- Population (billions)
- Climate vulnerability [0, 1]
- Carrying capacity
- Current refugee burden
- Social tension from refugees

**Refugee mechanics:**
- Crisis triggers displacement (% of regional population)
- Refugees flow to nearest regions based on:
  - Geographic proximity (60% weight)
  - Carrying capacity (30% weight)
  - Existing burden (10% weight - avoid overloaded regions)
- Refugees have status: Transit ‚Üí Resettled vs Stranded
- Mortality based on status (research-backed rates above)
- Resettlement takes time (6-24 months to reach camps)
- Generational integration (25 years)

**Crisis-specific displacement:**
- Climate: 5-30% of vulnerable regions
- War: 20-40% of affected regions
- Nuclear: 50-70% of bombed regions
- Famine: 10-30% of starving regions

### **Phase 2: Enhanced National System (Future)**

After Multipolar/International Competition system (TIER 1.4):
- Per-nation tracking (not just 6 regions)
- Bilateral refugee flows (Bangladesh ‚Üí India)
- Migration routes with danger/cost
- Diaspora networks
- Border policies per nation
- See Appendix in population-dynamics plan for full design
