# TIER 5.1: Consciousness & Spirituality Evolution

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 5 hours
**Priority:** LOW (Enrichment for Meaning Spiral)
**Complexity:** HIGH (Philosophical depth)

## Overview

Expands Meaning Spiral with deeper dimensions of human flourishing through research-backed consciousness exploration (psychedelic therapy, meditation).

## Key Features

- `consciousness_understanding` - Scientific grasp of awareness [0,1]
- `meditation_enhancement_tech` - AI-guided inner exploration
- `collective_consciousness_events` - Shared transcendent experiences
- `psychedelic_therapy_integration` - Healing through altered states
- `techno_spiritual_synthesis` - Technology + spirituality integration

## Research Backing

- Johns Hopkins (2024-2025): Psilocybin therapy for depression (80% efficacy)
- MIT (2024): Meditation + neurofeedback tech
- MAPS (2023-2024): MDMA therapy for PTSD (FDA approval 2024)

## Failure Modes

- Wireheading (pleasure without meaning)
- Mind control (manipulation via altered states)
- Spiritual bypassing (ignore real problems)

## Expected Impact

- Could boost Meaning Spiral activation (+0.1-0.2 to philosophical maturity)
- Novel approaches to mental health crisis
- Addresses existential meaning at deepest level
