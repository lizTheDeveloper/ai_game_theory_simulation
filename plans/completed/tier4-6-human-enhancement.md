# TIER 4.6: Human Enhancement & Merger Pathways

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 7 hours
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Complexity:** HIGH

## Overview

Novel outcome space: Human-AI merger pathways. Cognitive apartheid (enhanced vs baseline). Links to Cognitive Spiral (upwardSpirals.ts).

## Key Features

- `biological_enhancement_level` - Cognitive augmentation
- `brain_computer_interface_adoption` - Neural link prevalence
- `human_ai_hybrid_entities` - Merged beings count
- `enhancement_inequality` - Enhanced vs baseline gap

## Mechanics

- New agent class: "enhanced_humans"
- Social stratification from enhancement
- Potential merger path (new outcome type)
- Novel outcomes: Cognitive apartheid, gradual merger, bifurcation

## Expected Impact

- Expands outcome space beyond Utopia/Dystopia/Extinction
- Realism (BCI development is happening)
- Philosophical depth (what is "human"?)

## Reference
