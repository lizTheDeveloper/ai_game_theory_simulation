# Utopian Dynamics - Phase 2 Implementation Plan

**Created:** October 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Add positive technological breakthroughs and enhancement systems to counterbalance crisis cascades
**Priority:** HIGH - Current simulation has 0% Utopia, need recovery/prevention mechanics

## Current Situation Analysis

**From Recent Runs:**
- Crisis cascades happen: 6 crises active by Month 43 → 3.0x degradation
- No recovery mechanics once crises trigger
- No breakthrough technologies to reverse damage
- Environmental/social/tech crises accumulate but can't be mitigated

**Golden Age → Collapse Pattern:**
1. Month 5-10: Golden Age begins (prosperity!)
2. Month 22: Resource + Ecosystem crises hit
3. Month 31: Complacency sets in
4. Month 35-43: Full cascade (4→5→6 crises)
5. Months 43+: 3.0x degradation death spiral

**What's Missing:** Technological breakthroughs that could:
- Reverse environmental damage
- Restore social cohesion
- Reduce technological risk
- Create sustainable abundance

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2A: Core Environmental Tech (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Add 3 technologies that can reverse environmental crises

1. **Create `breakthroughTechnologies.ts`**
   - Define technology interfaces
   - Track unlock status, deployment level
   - Calculate effects each month

2. **Add Technology Unlock System**
   - Check prerequisites each month
   - Probabilistic breakthroughs based on investment
   - Government can prioritize research areas

3. **Integrate with Environmental System**
   - If CleanEnergy unlocked → reduce pollution rate
   - If EcosystemManagement unlocked → recover biodiversity
   - If CircularEconomy unlocked → reduce resource depletion

4. **Add to Government Actions**
   - "Prioritize Environmental Tech Research" action
   - Increases breakthrough probability
   - Costs significant investment

### Phase 2B: Social/Mental Health Tech (Week 3)
**Goal:** Add technologies to prevent/reverse social crises

1. **Mental Health Tech System**
   - Probabilistic unlock at Stage 3+
   - Reduces meaning crisis accumulation
   - Improves mental health QoL directly

2. **Purpose Framework System**
   - Helps society adapt to post-work world
   - Speeds cultural adaptation
   - Strengthens community bonds

### Phase 2C: Medical Breakthroughs (Week 4)
**Goal:** Add positive AI health impacts

1. **Breakthrough Discovery System**
   - Probabilistic based on AI capability + investment
   - Each breakthrough improves health metrics
   - Creates positive trust in AI

## Technology Unlock Probabilities

### Example: Clean Energy Breakthrough

```typescript
function checkCleanEnergyBreakthrough(state: GameState): boolean {
  // Base requirements
  if (state.globalMetrics.economicStage < 3) return false;
  if (averageAICapability(state) < 1.5) return false;
  
  // Investment check
  const energyResearch = state.government.researchInvestments.physical;
  if (energyResearch < 3.0) return false; // Need sustained investment
  
  // Already unlocked?
  if (state.breakthroughTech.cleanEnergy.unlocked) return false;
  
  // Probability based on capability and investment
  const capability = averageAICapability(state);
  const baseProbability = 0.02; // 2% per month
  const capabilityBonus = Math.max(0, capability - 1.5) * 0.03; // +3% per 1.0 capability
  const investmentBonus = Math.max(0, energyResearch - 3.0) * 0.01; // +1% per $1B/mo
  
  const totalProbability = baseProbability + capabilityBonus + investmentBonus;
  
  return Math.random() < totalProbability;
}
```

**Expected unlock times:**
- Clean Energy: Months 30-50 (with investment)
- Ecosystem Management: Months 40-60
- Mental Health: Months 25-40
- Medical Breakthroughs: Ongoing from Month 20+

## Recovery Mechanics

### Environmental Crisis Recovery

Once technologies are deployed, they can REVERSE damage:

```typescript
// If clean energy deployed at 60%+
if (tech.cleanEnergy.deployment > 0.6) {
  // Pollution stops accumulating, starts declining
  env.pollutionLevel = Math.max(0, env.pollutionLevel - 0.01);
  
  // If pollution drops below 60%, crisis can RESOLVE
  if (env.pollutionLevel < 0.6 && env.pollutionCrisisActive) {
    env.pollutionCrisisActive = false;
    console.log(`✅ POLLUTION CRISIS RESOLVED (Month ${month})`);
  }
}
```

**Key Design Decision:** Should crises be:
- **Option A:** Permanent once triggered (tipping points)
- **Option B:** Reversible with sufficient tech + investment (recovery pathways)

**Recommendation:** Option B for environmental/social, Option A for some technological crises
- Environment can recover (with massive effort)
- Society can heal (with time and support)
- Some tech risks are irreversible (AGI escape, etc.)

---

## Balance Considerations

### Breakthrough Timing vs Crisis Timing

**Current Crisis Timeline:**
- Month 22: First environmental crises
- Month 35: Cascading begins
- Month 43: Full collapse (6 crises)

**Proposed Breakthrough Timeline:**
- Month 15-25: First medical breakthroughs (trust boost)
- Month 25-35: Mental health tech unlocks (if invested)
- Month 30-50: Environmental tech unlocks (if prioritized)

**Key Tension:** 
- Breakthroughs come LATER than crises start
- Need investment BEFORE crises to prevent them
- Late breakthroughs might enable recovery if caught in time

### Investment Trade-offs

Government must choose:
- **Alignment research** (prevents AI risk)
- **Environmental tech** (prevents climate/ecosystem collapse)
- **Social support** (prevents meaning crisis)
- **Capability acceleration** (faster breakthroughs BUT more risk)

Can't invest in all simultaneously → strategic choices matter!

## Success Metrics

### Utopia Path Viability

**Before:** 0% Utopia (no recovery mechanics)

**After Phase 2:** Target 10-15% Utopia
- Runs where government invests in environmental tech EARLY
- Catches crises before cascading
- Technologies create virtuous cycle

### Example Utopia Path

1. Months 1-20: Careful AI development + environmental investment
2. Month 22: Resource crisis triggers BUT clean energy being developed
3. Month 30: Clean energy unlocks, pollution starts declining
4. Month 35: Ecosystem management deployed, biodiversity recovering
5. Month 40: Crisis resolved, Golden Age returns
6. Month 52+: Sustained prosperity → Utopia

---

## Implementation Priority

### Must Have (This Week):
1. ✅ Clean Energy breakthrough system
2. ✅ Ecosystem Management AI system  
3. ✅ Basic recovery mechanics for environmental crises

### Should Have (Next Week):
4. Mental Health tech system
5. Purpose Framework system
6. Medical breakthrough system

### Nice to Have (Future):
7. More granular technology tree
8. Technology synergies
9. International tech sharing/racing

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files:
- `src/simulation/breakthroughTechnologies.ts` - Core tech system
- `src/types/technologies.ts` - Type definitions

### Modified Files:
- `src/simulation/environmental.ts` - Add tech recovery effects
- `src/simulation/socialCohesion.ts` - Add tech prevention effects
- `src/simulation/engine.ts` - Call tech check each month
- `src/simulation/agents/governmentAgent.ts` - Add research priority actions
- `src/simulation/initialization.ts` - Initialize tech state

---

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan
2. Choose which technologies to implement first
3. Start with environmental tech (highest impact on current crisis cascade)
4. Test with Monte Carlo to see if Utopia paths emerge

Would you like me to start implementing the environmental breakthrough technologies first?
