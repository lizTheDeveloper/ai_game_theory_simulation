# Evidence-Based Recovery Mechanisms - RESEARCH INVALIDATED

**Date Created:** October 17, 2025
**Date Archived:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** RESEARCH INVALIDATED - DO NOT IMPLEMENT
**Reason:** Agent consensus (research-skeptic + super-alignment-researcher) found recovery impossible at >90% mortality

---

## Executive Summary

This plan proposed three evidence-based recovery mechanisms to address 100% pyrrhic-dystopia outcomes in 1200-month extended simulations (91.2% mortality). After comprehensive research validation, both research-skeptic and super-alignment-researcher reached consensus: **Recovery from >90% mortality is impossible according to empirical research.**

**Validation Results (1200-month simulations, N=50):**
- 100% pyrrhic-dystopia (98% dystopia, 2% extinction)
- 91.2% average mortality (7.3 billion deaths)
- 96-year continuous crisis periods
- 100% water insecurity
- All planetary boundaries exceeded
- 94% cascade persistence rate

## Proposed Mechanisms (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### 1. Disaster Cooperation Boost
**Research:** Wei et al. (2025), Drury et al. (2019), Zaki & Cikara (2020)
**Proposed:** 15-30% cooperation boost during 12-24 month acute phase

**INVALIDATION REASON:**
- Research examines LOCAL disasters (<1% mortality), not civilizational collapse
- Extrapolating to 91% mortality is scientifically unjustified
- Historical counter-evidence: Thirty Years' War (40% mortality) → continued warfare, not cooperation
- Pelling & Dill (2010): Cooperation requires surviving state capacity (absent at 91% mortality)

### 2. Tipping Point Reversibility
**Research:** Wunderling et al. (2025), Carbon Brief (2024), Betts et al. (2023)
**Proposed:** 20-30% of tipping points reversible with dampening feedbacks

**INVALIDATION REASON:**
- Cherry-picking: Arctic ice is reversible, but permafrost, WAIS, Amazon are NOT
- Reality: 70-80% of tipping points are irreversible (overwhelms 20-30% reversible)
- Physical prerequisites for reversal (desalination fabs, grid operators) absent at 91% mortality
- Puerto Rico example: 0.05% mortality + full US support took 11 months for power restoration

### 3. Extended Simulation Timeframes
**Research:** Black Death (80-150 year recovery from 40% mortality)
**Proposed:** Extend to 1200 months (100 years) to capture recovery arc

**INVALIDATION REASON:**
- Black Death precedent (40% mortality) doesn't scale to 91% mortality
- Historical precedents for non-recovery: Bronze Age Collapse, Western Rome, Maya (all terminal)
- Genetic bottleneck effects: Henn et al. (2016) - <10,000 individuals → inbreeding depression
- Thermodynamic reality: Tainter (1988) - Complexity requires energy inputs absent post-collapse

## Research-Skeptic Critique Summary

**Key Finding:** The 100% pyrrhic-dystopia outcome is likely **REALISTIC, not a bug**.

**Critical Flaws Identified:**
1. **Methodological Error:** Extrapolating local disaster cooperation to global collapse
2. **Cherry-Picking:** Citing reversible tipping points, ignoring irreversible majority
3. **Physical Prerequisites Ignored:** Technology requires specialists lost at 91% mortality
4. **Genetic Bottleneck Effects:** Insufficient diversity for recovery below 10,000 individuals

**Missing Negative Mechanisms (Model May Be Too Optimistic):**
- Nuclear winter: Robock et al. (2019) - 100 warheads → 2B famine deaths
- Wet bulb temperature events: Raymond et al. (2020) - 35°C = death in 6 hours
- Antimicrobial resistance: WHO - 10M annual deaths by 2050

## Super-Alignment-Researcher Validation

**After comprehensive literature review (25+ sources, 2023-2025):**

**CONCUR with research-skeptic's assessment:**
1. Disaster cooperation doesn't scale to 91% mortality - HIGH confidence
2. Most tipping points irreversible (70-80%) - MEDIUM confidence
3. Physical prerequisites absent at 91% mortality - HIGH confidence
4. 100% pyrrhic-dystopia is REALISTIC - Historical precedent supports

**Core Research Finding:**
**Prevention is 10-100x more effective than recovery** (crisis management literature)

**Once 91% mortality occurs:**
Thermodynamic, social, institutional constraints make recovery impossible within human timescales.

## Alternative Approach: PREVENTION Mechanisms

Instead of post-catastrophe recovery, implement **prevention mechanisms** to widen the 2% humane utopia pathway:

### HIGH PRIORITY Prevention Mechanisms (TRL 6-8, Empirical Backing):

1. **Positive Tipping Point Cascades** (8-12h complexity)
   - OECD 2025, ESD 2024: Policy interventions trigger cascading adoption
   - Empirical: Solar PV + EV exponential growth 2023-2025
   - Expected impact: +5-15% humane utopia rate (prevention)

2. **Early Warning Systems for Tipping Points** (6-10h complexity)
   - TipESM, IPCC 2023-2025: Operational systems (TRL 7)
   - Detection at 0.8-0.95 threshold → emergency intervention
   - Expected impact: +3-8% catastrophe avoidance

3. **Cooperative Spirals from Alignment Success** (5-8h complexity)
   - Acemoglu & Robinson 2001: Critical junctures enable institutional reform
   - Historical: Montreal Protocol, democratic transitions
   - Expected impact: +2-5% humane utopia rate (stability)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY Missing Negative Mechanisms:

4. **Nuclear Winter Effects** (4-6h complexity)
   - Robock et al. 2019: 100 warheads → 2B famine deaths
   - Make nuclear outcomes more realistic

5. **Wet Bulb Temperature Events** (3-5h complexity)
   - Raymond et al. 2020: 35°C wet bulb = death in 6 hours
   - Climate-driven uninhabitability

6. **Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis** (4-7h complexity)
   - WHO projections: 10M annual deaths by 2050
   - Baseline mortality increase over time

---

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Prevention is Everything:** Recovery from 91% mortality is impossible
2. **The 2% Humane Utopia Window is Critical:** Miss it, no second chance
3. **Civilizational Collapse is a Terminal Attractor:** Supported by history (Bronze Age, Rome, Maya)
4. **Disaster Sociology Doesn't Scale:** Local disaster research ≠ global collapse
5. **Most Tipping Points Are Irreversible:** 70-80% cannot be reversed once crossed
6. **Physical Prerequisites Matter:** Technology requires specialists, infrastructure, energy

---

## Agent Consensus

**research-skeptic:** "The absence of recovery is a FEATURE showing the stakes, not a bug to fix."

**super-alignment-researcher:** "AGREE - Focus on prevention mechanisms to widen 2% humane utopia pathway."

**Quality Gate Decision:** FAILED for recovery mechanisms, PASSED for prevention mechanisms

## Roadmap Impact

**REMOVED from Roadmap:**
- Evidence-Based Recovery Mechanisms (15-25h) - Research invalidated

**ADDED to Roadmap (HIGH PRIORITY):**
1. Positive Tipping Point Cascades (8-12h)
2. Early Warning Systems (6-10h)
3. Cooperative Spirals from Alignment Success (5-8h)

**ADDED to Roadmap (MEDIUM PRIORITY):**
4. Nuclear Winter Effects (4-6h)
5. Wet Bulb Temperature Events (3-5h)
6. Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis (4-7h)

**Total Shift:** Recovery approach (15-25h) → Prevention approach (30-48h)
**Reason:** Prevention is 10-100x more effective than recovery (research consensus)

## Final Status

**This plan is ARCHIVED and should NOT be implemented.**

The research validation process worked correctly: proposed mechanisms were rigorously evaluated, found to lack empirical support at relevant scales, and rejected. The alternative prevention-focused approach has strong empirical backing and should be implemented instead.
