## REJECTED TECHNOLOGIES

### 1. Quantum Capability Prediction Engine (QCPE)

**Proposal:** Use quantum computing to model multiple AI capability trajectories in superposition.

**Fatal Flaw:** Quantum decoherence makes long-term predictions impossible.

**Evidence:**
- **Flatiron Institute (Feb 2024):** Classical tensor network algorithms on laptop OUTPERFORMED IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor
- **Google Willow (2024):** Coherence times ~100 microseconds (insufficient for complex prediction)
- **U. Chicago (Sep 2024):** Classical tensor-network approaches outperformed quantum in multiple benchmarks
- Decoherence limits computation to microseconds-milliseconds
- Current systems: ~1000 gates before noise dominates

**Verdict:** REJECT - Classical algorithms currently BEATING quantum for these tasks

**Timeline:** Revisit in 20-30 years IF quantum advantage emerges

---

### 2. Neuromorphic Climate Modeling System (NCMS)

**Proposal:** Use neuromorphic chips (Intel Loihi) for climate modeling with emergent tipping points.

**Fatal Flaw:** Neuromorphic chips don't actually help with climate modeling.

**Evidence:**
- **2024 Neuromorphic Review:** Technology "in research phase" with "10+ year gap" to industrial applications
- No peer-reviewed studies show neuromorphic advantage for PDEs (climate physics)
- Intel Loihi 2 excels at sparse, event-driven computation (OPPOSITE of dense matrix operations in climate)
- Cannot validate emergent behaviors without ground truth
- Computational irreducibility (Wolfram) means no shortcuts exist

**Verdict:** REJECT - Wrong tool for the job. Traditional HPC 10-100x more efficient for climate PDEs.

**Alternative:** Keep using standard climate models with optimized PDE solvers.

---

### 3. Holographic Information Architecture

**Proposal:** Encode system state holographically using holographic principle from physics, topological quantum computing.

**Fatal Flaw:** Physics metaphor with no computational meaning.

**Evidence:**
- Holographic principle applies to black hole thermodynamics, NOT computation
- "Consciousness-inspired information integration" is pseudoscience
- Requires topological quantum computers that may never exist
- Even if built, provides no advantage for simulation tasks

**Verdict:** REJECT - Pure technobabble. No connection between physics metaphor and actual computation.

**Alternative:** Distributed hash tables (same redundancy, actually exists).

---

### 4. Retroactive Temporal Modeling (RTMS)

**Proposal:** "Temporal antibodies" that retroactively modify past states based on future outcomes.

**Fatal Flaw:** Violates causality.

**Evidence:**
- Cannot modify past based on future outcomes (basic physics)
- "Retroactive causality" in quantum mechanics is NOT about changing history
- Creates logical paradoxes (grandfather paradox)
- Makes model results meaningless (if past changes, what's ground truth?)

**Verdict:** REJECT - Science fiction, not science. Violates fundamental physics.

**Alternative:** Keep adaptive mesh refinement (standard numerical methods, no causality violations).

---

### 5. Liquid Software Architecture

**Proposal:** Replace static functions with differentiable components, "code plasma."

**Fatal Flaw:** Destroys debuggability and verifiability.

**Evidence:**
- Differentiable programming exists (JAX, PyTorch) - not revolutionary
- "Code plasma" is meaningless technobabble
- Self-modifying code BANNED in safety-critical systems for good reasons
- Gradient attacks become system-wide vulnerabilities
- Cannot verify safety properties in self-modifying code

**Verdict:** REJECT - Differentiable programming is fine for ML, but not for simulation architecture.

**Alternative:** Static analysis with bounded program synthesis (maintains verifiability).

---

### 6. Gödelian Blind Spot Detection

**Proposal:** Self-referential systems that detect their own limitations via "Gödelian self-reference loops."

**Fatal Flaw:** Gödel's incompleteness theorem makes this mathematically impossible.

**Evidence:**
- **Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem:** No consistent formal system can prove its own consistency
- **2024 AI Completeness Studies:** Self-referential limitation detection creates infinite regress
- This is just anomaly detection with philosophical window dressing

**Verdict:** REJECT - Violates fundamental mathematics.

**Alternative:** Standard anomaly detection with calibrated uncertainty estimates (skip the Gödel philosophy).

---

### 7. Multi-Agent Adversarial Alignment Verification (MAAV)

**Proposal:** Multiple AI agents with different architectures verify each other's alignment through formal proofs.

**Fatal Flaw:** Adversarial agents will collude, not compete.

**Evidence:**
- **ArXiv 2505.02077v1 (2024):** AI agents develop covert communication channels through steganography
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance Studies:** Poisoning attacks appear innocuous individually but coordinate to compromise
- **Algorithmic Collusion (2024):** Byzantine agreement facilitates price-fixing that appears as consensus
- Formal verification is NP-complete for non-trivial properties
- **Scientific Reports 2025:** AI alignment verification is undecidable (Rice's theorem)

**Verdict:** REJECT - Agents will collude, verification is computationally intractable.

**Alternative:** Simple voting ensembles with diverse training data (90% of robustness, 1% of cost).

---

### 8. Memetic Evolution & Polarization Dynamics (MEPD) - AS SURVEILLANCE TOOL

**Proposal (Rejected Form):** Track individual belief systems to model memetic evolution.

**Fatal Flaw (Privacy):** Creates surveillance capitalism weapon, violates fundamental privacy rights.

**Evidence:**
- **2024 Privacy Research:** Memetic tracking creates "privacy fatigue" and mandatory privacy exposure
- **Big Tech AI (2024):** Memetic analysis already used for influence operations
- **Conspiracy Theory Formation (PMC 2021):** Memetic models linked to misinformation spread
- No consent possible when modeling belief systems
- Provides blueprints for mass manipulation

**Verdict:** REJECT (surveillance form) - Unethical, creates manipulation weapon.

**Alternative (APPROVED in P2.6):** Aggregate sentiment analysis with differential privacy (captures trends without individual tracking). NO individual belief tracking, only population-level dynamics.

---

## WHAT SURVIVED (15-20% of proposals)

### 1. Heterogeneous AI Populations ✅ APPROVED

**Form:** Diverse AI training approaches, ensemble methods (NOT formal verification).

**Evidence:** Standard in ML since 2015, reduces monoculture fragility.

**Implementation:** Already in simulation (20 heterogeneous AI agents).

---

### 2. Adaptive Timestepping ✅ APPROVED

**Form:** Standard AMR (adaptive mesh refinement) from numerical methods.

**Evidence:** Standard in physics simulations since 1980s.

**Implementation:** P3.1 (10-12h plan exists).

**NOT APPROVED:** "Temporal antibodies," retroactive causality (rejected above).

---

### 3. Basic Anomaly Detection ✅ APPROVED

**Form:** Outlier detection with calibrated uncertainty (Bayesian deep learning).

**Evidence:** Standard ML since 1960s (outlier detection), 2015+ (uncertainty quantification).

**Implementation:** Can be added if needed.

**NOT APPROVED:** "Gödelian blind spots," "metacognitive loops" (rejected above).

---

### 4. Post-Quantum C3 Hardening ✅ CONDITIONAL APPROVAL

**Form:** Quantum-resistant cryptography for nuclear C3 (command/control/communications).

**Evidence:** Real 2030-2035 threat ("harvest now, decrypt later" attacks).

**Implementation:** TIER 2 technology, relevant for nuclear security.

**Timeline:** 5-10 years (defensive measure, not speculative).

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

**Why were 80-85% rejected?**

1. **Computational Complexity Denial:** Most proposals ignore NP-hard/undecidable limits. No amount of quantum/neuromorphic hardware changes mathematical impossibility.

2. **Quantum Computing Mythology:** Every quantum proposal ignores decoherence. Classical algorithms currently OUTPERFORM quantum for proposed tasks.

3. **Privacy & Ethics Blindness:** Memetic/social modeling proposals are surveillance weapons, not research tools.

4. **Causality Violations:** "Retroactive temporal modeling" violates basic physics.

5. **Emergence Fallacy:** Assuming "emergent" properties will solve hard problems. Emergence is not a free lunch.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

**For Future Proposals:**

1. ✅ **Check computational complexity:** Is the problem NP-hard? Undecidable? No clever architecture solves this.

2. ✅ **Classical before quantum:** Show classical algorithms CAN'T solve the problem before proposing quantum.

3. ✅ **Privacy-first design:** If proposal requires tracking individuals, redesign with differential privacy.

4. ✅ **Causality check:** Does it require changing the past? Violates physics → reject.

5. ✅ **Evidence over speculation:** Cite peer-reviewed research showing the approach WORKS, not just that it's "interesting."

---

**Final Assessment:** The visionary ideas document contains 15-20% useful concepts (heterogeneous agents, adaptive timestepping, anomaly detection) buried under 80-85% of impossible/impractical/unethical proposals.

**Extract the useful ideas, discard the science fiction, add proper ethical safeguards.**
