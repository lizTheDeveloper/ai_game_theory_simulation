# TIER 4.6: Human Enhancement & Merger Pathways

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (Oct 16, 2025)
**Actual Time:** 8 hours
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Complexity:** HIGH
**Research:** `reviews/bionic-skills-validation-20251016.md`, `reviews/bionic-skills-skeptical-review-20251016.md`

## Overview

Novel outcome space: Human-AI merger pathways through AI-assisted cognitive amplification. Models the transition from AI as tool to AI as cognitive enhancement, with potential for merger and stratification outcomes.

**Research Foundation:** Peer-reviewed studies show:
- AI disproportionately benefits lower-skilled workers (Brynjolfsson et al. 2025, NBER)
- Digital divide limits access (29% rural exclusion, IMF 2023)
- Skill gaps drive productivity variance (PIAAC 2023, 28% at low literacy)
- Enhancement creates new inequality vectors (access, adoption, effectiveness)

## Key Features

### Core State Variables
- `biological_enhancement_level` - Cognitive augmentation adoption [0-1]
- `brain_computer_interface_adoption` - Neural link prevalence [0-1]
- `ai_augmentation_level` - Current AI-assisted enhancement [0-1]
- `human_ai_hybrid_entities` - Merged beings count
- `enhancement_inequality` - Enhanced vs baseline gap (Gini coefficient)

### Population Segmentation
- Enhanced Elite (5%) - Full AI augmentation + future BCI
- Augmented Middle (40%) - Partial AI tools access
- Digital Divide (35%) - Limited/no access to enhancement
- Enhancement Resistant (15%) - Voluntary rejection
- Locked Out (5%) - Structural barriers prevent access

## Mechanics

### Phase 1: AI-Assisted Enhancement (Current State)
- Skill amplification through AI tools (validated by Brynjolfsson 2025)
- Access inequality based on economic/geographic/education factors
- Productivity multiplier: 0.4x (no access) to 1.7x (full augmentation)
- Novice amplification: Up to 60% productivity gain (conservative vs 34% empirical)

### Phase 2: BCI Adoption Pathway (Future State)
- Gradual BCI adoption curve (S-curve, elite early adopters)
- Cost barriers: $100K-$1M initially, declining over time
- Safety concerns slow adoption (neuroethics, brain hacking)
- Military/corporate pressure for adoption

### Phase 3: Merger Mechanics
- Cognitive stratification threshold: When enhancement gap > 2x baseline
- New agent class: "enhanced_humans" with hybrid capabilities
- Potential merger path: Human consciousness uploaded to AI substrate
- Social bifurcation: Enhanced vs baseline populations diverge

### Novel Outcomes
1. **Cognitive Apartheid** - Permanent underclass unable to participate in enhanced economy
2. **Gradual Merger** - Smooth transition to human-AI hybrid civilization
3. **Bifurcation** - Two separate species: baseline humans + enhanced/merged entities
4. **Enhancement Trap** - Dependence on AI creates vulnerability to manipulation
5. **Neo-Luddite Resistance** - Violent rejection of enhancement creates conflict

## Expected Impact

- Expands outcome space beyond Utopia/Dystopia/Extinction
- Models realistic AI augmentation trajectory (not just sci-fi BCI)
- Captures enhancement inequality as new axis of dystopia
- Links to existing systems:
  - QoL (enhancement affects material abundance, autonomy, meaning)
  - Social cohesion (inequality drives fragmentation)
  - Upward Spirals (Cognitive Spiral amplified by enhancement)
  - Dystopia paths (Corporate Feudalism through cognitive stratification)
