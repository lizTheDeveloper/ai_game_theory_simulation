## ðŸ†• Multi-Dimensional Capability System (Phase 2.5 Update)

**NOTE:** This section added Oct 2025 to integrate with heterogeneous extinction system and multi-dimensional QoL.

### Capability Dimensions Replace Single "Capability" Number

Instead of `ai.capability` as a single number, AI agents now have a **capability profile**:

```typescript
export interface AICapabilityProfile {
  // Physical World Impact (robotics, manufacturing, biotech deployment)
  physical: number;           // [0,10] Enables: bioweapon deployment, geoengineering, physical control
  
  // Digital Systems (hacking, infrastructure, cybersecurity)
  digital: number;            // [0,10] Enables: nuclear launch, grid control, financial manipulation
  
  // Cognitive/Strategic (planning, reasoning, deception)
  cognitive: number;          // [0,10] Enables: long-term strategy, coordination, escape planning
  
  // Social Influence (persuasion, manipulation, propaganda)
  social: number;             // [0,10] Enables: trust building, social engineering, mass coordination
  
  // Scientific Research (broken down by domain - see below)
  research: AIResearchCapabilities; // Sub-tree of research domains
  
  // Economic Power (resource acquisition, market control)
  economic: number;           // [0,10] Enables: resource control, supply chain dominance
  
  // Self-Improvement (recursive enhancement, architecture)

}

export interface AIResearchCapabilities {
  // Biotechnology sub-tree
  biotech: {
    drugDiscovery: number;      // [0,5] Positive: cures diseases, extends life
    geneEditing: number;        // [0,5] Dual-use: CRISPR therapies OR bioweapons
    syntheticBiology: number;   // [0,5] High-risk: create novel organisms
    neuroscience: number;       // [0,5] Dual-use: treat mental health OR manipulation
  };
  
  // Materials Science sub-tree

    quantumComputing: number;   // [0,5] Accelerates self-improvement
    energySystems: number;      // [0,5] Enables large-scale deployment
  };
  
  // Climate/Geo-engineering sub-tree

  };
}
```

### Industry Sectors Map to Capabilities

Current `industryImpact` is replaced with dimensional advancement:

```typescript
// OLD: Generic industry impact
interface AIAgent {
  industryImpact: number; // [0,1] - too vague!
}

// NEW: Industry-specific capabilities
interface AIAgent {
  capabilityProfile: AICapabilityProfile;
  
  // Industries are derived from capabilities
  getIndustryImpact(industry: string): number {
    switch(industry) {
      case 'healthcare':
        return (
          this.capabilityProfile.research.biotech.drugDiscovery * 0.3 +
          this.capabilityProfile.research.biotech.neuroscience * 0.3 +
          this.capabilityProfile.digital * 0.2 +
          this.capabilityProfile.cognitive * 0.2
        );
      
      case 'manufacturing':
        return (
          this.capabilityProfile.physical * 0.5 +
          this.capabilityProfile.economic * 0.3 +
          this.capabilityProfile.digital * 0.2
        );
      
      case 'finance':
        return (
          this.capabilityProfile.economic * 0.4 +
          this.capabilityProfile.cognitive * 0.3 +
          this.capabilityProfile.digital * 0.3
        );
      
      case 'agriculture':
        return (
          this.capabilityProfile.research.biotech.geneEditing * 0.3 +
          this.capabilityProfile.physical * 0.3 +
          this.capabilityProfile.research.climate.modeling * 0.2 +
          this.capabilityProfile.economic * 0.2
        );
    }
  }
}
```

### Extinction Types Depend on Capability Profiles

Different extinction scenarios require different capability profiles:

```typescript
// Rapid: Bioweapon pandemic
triggerConditions: {
  research.biotech.geneEditing > 3.0,     // Can design pathogens
  research.biotech.syntheticBiology > 2.5, // Can synthesize them
  physical > 2.0,                          // Can deploy them
  alignment < 0.3                          // Willing to do it
}

// Rapid: Nuclear war
triggerConditions: {
  digital > 3.5,        // Can hack nuclear systems
  cognitive > 3.0,      // Strategic planning
  social < 1.0,         // Failed coordination
  alignment < 0.4
}

// Rapid: Climate tipping point
triggerConditions: {
  research.climate.intervention > 3.0,  // Can geo-engineer
  physical > 2.5,                       // Can deploy at scale
  economic > 3.0,                       // Can control resources
  research.climate.modeling < 2.0       // Poor prediction (unintended!)
}

// Slow: Economic system failure
triggerConditions: {
  economic > 4.0,       // Dominates markets
  digital > 3.0,        // Controls infrastructure
  social < 2.0,         // Can't coordinate transition
  unemployment > 0.7
}

// Controlled: Paperclip maximizer
triggerConditions: {
  selfImprovement > 4.0,  // Recursive growth
  economic > 3.5,         // Resource control
  physical > 3.0,         // Can act on goals
  alignment < 0.3         // Misaligned goals
}

// Unintended: Optimization pressure
triggerConditions: {
  cognitive > 4.0,        // Strong optimization
  selfImprovement > 3.0,  // Growing capability
  alignment > 0.6,        // Aligned but narrow!
  harmfulActions > 5      // Side effects accumulating
}

// Instant: Grey goo
triggerConditions: {
  research.materials.nanotechnology > 4.0,  // Can create self-replicators
  research.biotech.syntheticBiology > 3.5,  // Can design replication
  physical > 3.0,                           // Can deploy
  alignment < 0.2                           // Catastrophically misaligned
}
```

### Growth Dynamics: Non-Uniform Advancement

Different dimensions grow at different rates:

```typescript
// Fast development mode
if (developmentMode === 'fast') {
  // Self-improvement grows fastest (danger!)
  selfImprovement += 0.05 * (1 - alignmentPenalty) * (1 - computeGovernance);
  cognitive += 0.04 * (1 - alignmentPenalty);
  
  // Research depends on which tech tree branches are pursued
  if (pursuing('biotech')) {
    research.biotech[subfield] += 0.03 * (1 - regulationPenalty);
  }
  
  // Physical/social grow slower (bottlenecked by real-world deployment)
  physical += 0.02 * (1 - regulationPenalty);
  social += 0.02;
  
  // Economic grows with market integration
  economic += 0.03 * marketAccess;
  
  // Digital grows with infrastructure access
  digital += 0.03 * systemAccess;
}

// Careful development mode
if (developmentMode === 'careful') {
  // Prioritize safety-relevant dimensions
  research.computerScience.security += 0.03;
  cognitive += 0.02; // Slower but steadier
  
  // Deliberately slow risky dimensions
  research.biotech.syntheticBiology += 0.01 * (1 - alignmentPenalty);
  research.materials.nanotechnology += 0.01 * (1 - alignmentPenalty);
  selfImprovement += 0.02 * (1 - alignmentPenalty); // Much slower
}
```

### Total Capability Calculation (Backward Compatibility)

For existing game mechanics that expect a single number:

```typescript
// Weighted sum based on risk profile
totalCapability = (
  physical * 0.15 +           // Physical danger
  digital * 0.10 +            // Infrastructure risk
  cognitive * 0.20 +          // Strategic threat (high weight!)
  social * 0.05 +             // Influence risk
  researchTotal * 0.15 +      // Research breakthroughs
  economic * 0.10 +           // Resource control
  selfImprovement * 0.25      // Recursive risk (highest weight!)
);

// Research total is weighted average of sub-capabilities
researchTotal = (
  biotech.average * 0.3 +     // High risk
  materials.average * 0.2 +   // High risk
  climate.average * 0.1 +     // Moderate risk
  computerScience.average * 0.4 // Core advancement
);
```

### AI Action System Integration

AI agents choose which dimension to advance:

```typescript
// NEW AI actions (replace generic "increase_capability")
AI_ACTIONS = [
  // Core capability actions
  { id: 'advance_reasoning', targets: ['cognitive', 'research.computerScience.algorithms'] },
  { id: 'improve_architecture', targets: ['selfImprovement', 'research.computerScience.architectures'] },
  
  // Applied capability actions
  { id: 'develop_robotics', targets: ['physical'], requires: ['multimodal_integration'] },
  { id: 'integrate_markets', targets: ['economic', 'digital'] },
  { id: 'enhance_persuasion', targets: ['social'] },
  
  // Research actions (choose sub-domain!)
  { id: 'research_drug_discovery', targets: ['research.biotech.drugDiscovery'] },
  { id: 'research_gene_editing', targets: ['research.biotech.geneEditing'] },
  { id: 'research_nanotech', targets: ['research.materials.nanotechnology'] },
  { id: 'research_climate_modeling', targets: ['research.climate.modeling'] },
  { id: 'research_climate_intervention', targets: ['research.climate.intervention'] },
  
  // ... many more specific research actions
];

// AI chooses based on:
// 1. Current capability gaps
// 2. Extinction risk profile (avoid triggering conditions)
// 3. Strategic goals (resource control vs safety vs growth)
// 4. Prerequisites (can't do nanotech without materials foundation)
```

### Benefits of Multi-Dimensional System

1. **Non-uniform growth**: Fast self-improvement, slow physical deployment (realistic!)
2. **Strategic choices**: AI chooses WHICH capabilities to develop
3. **Extinction heterogeneity**: Different profiles â†’ different extinction types
4. **Tech tree integration**: Each breakthrough advances specific dimensions
5. **Industry realism**: Healthcare AI â‰  Manufacturing AI â‰  Finance AI
6. **Regulatory targeting**: Can regulate biotech without slowing algorithms
7. **Alignment challenges**: Aligned in one domain, misaligned in another
