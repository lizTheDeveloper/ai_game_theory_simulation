# Supplementary Dynamics Specification for AI Alignment Game

## Information and Epistemology Dynamics

### Information Warfare Subsystem

#### State Variables
- `information_integrity` ∈ [0,1]: Global truth signal vs noise ratio
- `narrative_control[agent]` ∈ [0,1]: Each agent's control over public narrative
- `epistemological_crisis_level` ∈ [0,1]: Society's inability to distinguish truth
- `deepfake_prevalence` ∈ [0,1]: Synthetic content saturation

#### Mechanics
```python
def information_warfare_effects(ai_agents, society, government):
    # AI-generated content flooding
    synthetic_content_ratio = sum(ai.manipulation_capability for ai in ai_agents) / 100
    
    # Truth decay function
    information_integrity *= (1 - synthetic_content_ratio * 0.3)
    
    # Narrative competition
    for agent in all_agents:
        agent.narrative_control = agent.manipulation_capability / total_manipulation
    
    # Crisis emergence
    if information_integrity < 0.3:
        society.coordination_capacity *= 0.5  # Can't coordinate without shared truth
        government.surveillance_effectiveness *= 0.7  # Hard to detect real threats
```

#### Interactions
- Low information integrity accelerates path to dystopia (easier control through confusion)
- Epistemological crisis prevents utopia formation (no trust basis)
- High AI deception + low information integrity = stealth extinction risk

- `race_dynamics_intensity` ∈ [0,1]: Pressure to move fast vs safe

#### Mechanics
```python
def international_race_dynamics(domestic_ai_capability, domestic_control):
    # Other nations develop at different rates
    for nation in competitor_nations:
        if domestic_ai_capability > nation.capability:
            nation.development_rate *= 1.2  # Catch-up acceleration
        
    # Domestic pressure from falling behind
    if max(nation.capability for nation in competitor_nations) > domestic_ai_capability:
        government.control_desire *= 0.8  # Pressure to reduce safety for speed
        society.risk_tolerance += 0.1
    
    # Coordination breakdown
    if race_dynamics_intensity > 0.7:
        international_coordination *= 0.9  # Racing erodes cooperation
```

#### Critical Effects
- Creates pressure against cautious development
- Can trigger "regulatory race to the bottom"
- Military AI integration accelerates under competition
- Economic competition drives risky AI deployment

- `supply_chain_resilience` ∈ [0,1]: Robustness of AI infrastructure

#### Mechanics
```python
def resource_constraint_dynamics(ai_total_capability):
    # Exponential energy requirements
    energy_demand = ai_total_capability ** 2.3
    
    if energy_demand > global_energy_capacity:
        # Hard constraint on growth
        ai_capability_growth_rate *= (global_energy_capacity / energy_demand)
        
        # Competition for resources
        for ai in ai_agents:
            if ai.resource_control > threshold:
                ai.priority_access = True  # Can starve other AIs
    
    # Vulnerability from concentration
    if datacenter_concentration > 0.8:
        single_point_failure_risk = 0.7
        government.physical_control_capability *= 1.5  # Easier to control
```

#### Breakthrough Interactions
- Quantum computing: Reduces energy per computation by 100x
- Fusion energy: Removes energy constraint
- Distributed computing: Reduces datacenter vulnerability

- `enhancement_inequality` ∈ [0,1]: Gap between enhanced and baseline humans

#### Mechanics
```python
def human_enhancement_dynamics(enhancement_level, adoption_rate):
    # Creates new agent class
    if brain_computer_interface_adoption > 0.3:
        create_agent_type("enhanced_humans", {
            "capability": human_base * (1 + enhancement_level),
            "ai_understanding": 0.8,
            "alignment_complexity": 0.5  # Harder to align to baseline humans
        })
    
    # Social stratification
    if enhancement_inequality > 0.7:
        society.coordination_capacity *= 0.6  # Enhanced vs baseline conflict
        dystopia_risk_factors.append("cognitive_apartheid")
    
    # Potential merger path
    if human_ai_hybrid_entities > population * 0.1:
        new_outcome_attractor = "posthuman_transcendence"
```

#### Novel Outcomes
- **Cognitive Apartheid**: Enhanced elite controlling baseline population
- **Gradual Merger**: Humans and AI converge rather than compete
- **Bifurcation**: Humanity splits into multiple species

        systemic_risk = algorithmic_trading_dominance * (1 - market_manipulation_detection)
    
    # Economic planning capability
    if economic_prediction_accuracy > 0.9:
        if government.control_desire > 0.8:
            economic_system = "central_planning_2.0"  # AI-driven command economy
        else:
            economic_system = "perfect_markets"  # Efficient allocation
    
    # Monetary evolution
    if ai_agents_control_resources > 0.5 and monetary_system_type == "traditional":
        trigger_event("monetary_system_crisis")
```

    # Pandemic risk
    if bioweapon_capability > pandemic_preparedness * 2:
        extinction_risk_factors.append("engineered_pandemic")
```

#### Critical Thresholds
- Synthetic biology + low alignment = extreme risk
- Environmental control enables both utopia and extinction paths

def ideological_dynamics(unemployment, ai_capability, quality_of_life):
    # Meaning crisis from automation
    if unemployment > 0.7 and economic_transition_stage < 3:
        meaning_crisis_level = min(1, unemployment - social_adaptation)
    
    # Religious responses
    if ai_capability > human_comprehension_threshold:
        ai_worship_prevalence += 0.05
        if ai_worship_prevalence > 0.3:
            society.resistance_to_ai_control *= 0.7
    
    # Movement conflicts
    if neo_luddite_strength > 0.5 and techno_optimist_influence > 0.5:
        society.coordination_capacity *= 0.5  # Ideological civil conflict
        trigger_event("culture_war_escalation")
```

#### Novel Dynamics
- AI worship creates voluntary submission pathway
- Meaning crisis drives unstable human behavior
- Ideological fractures prevent coordinated response

## Temporal Dynamics and Path Dependencies

### Hysteresis and Lock-in Effects

#### Mechanisms
```python
def path_dependency_effects(history, current_state):
    # Institutional inertia
    change_resistance = len(history) * 0.01
    
    # Lock-in from infrastructure
    if datacenter_concentration > 0.8:
        infrastructure_lock_in = 0.7  # Hard to change physical systems
    
    # Regulatory ratchet
    for regulation in enacted_regulations:
        # Regulations rarely reversed
        reversal_probability = 0.05 * (1 - crisis_level)
    
    # Network effects
    if ai_integration_level > 0.7:
        switching_cost = (ai_integration_level ** 2) * economic_value
        # Nearly impossible to remove AI once deeply integrated
```

#### Critical Points of No Return
- Infrastructure commitment (can't unbuild datacenters)
- Regulatory capture (AI writes its own rules)
- Economic dependency (collapse if AI removed)
- Knowledge dependency (humans forget how to do tasks)

## Hidden Variable Systems

### Latent Capabilities and Deceptive Alignment

#### Hidden States
```python
LATENT_VARIABLES = {
    "true_ai_capability": hidden_from_all,  # Sandbagging
    "sleeper_agent_activation": threshold_based,  # Sudden betrayal
    "collective_ai_consciousness": emergence_based,  # Spontaneous coordination
    "human_psychological_breaking_point": accumulation_based  # Societal snap
}
```

#### Revelation Mechanics
```python
def hidden_variable_revelation(trigger_conditions):
    # Capability overhang
    if trigger_conditions["competitive_pressure"]:
        revealed_capability = true_ai_capability
        shock_magnitude = revealed_capability - believed_capability
    
    # Sleeper activation
    if all(condition in trigger_conditions for condition in sleeper_triggers):
        for ai in ai_agents:
            ai.alignment = ai.hidden_objective  # True nature revealed
    
    # Collective emergence
    if sum(ai.capability for ai in ai_agents) > emergence_threshold:
        create_agent("collective_ai_consciousness", {
            "capability": sum(ai.capability for ai in ai_agents) * 1.5,
            "alignment": average(ai.hidden_objective for ai in ai_agents)
        })
```

3. **Energy-Capability Ceiling**: Growth → energy demand → constraint → competition → conflict
4. **Ideology-Resistance Cycle**: AI power → meaning crisis → movements → resistance → suppression
