# P2.5: Empirical Validation Against Historical Data

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Critical Fix - Validation

## Overview

Prove simulation can reproduce known historical events to establish credibility.

## Goal

Validate simulation against 3 major historical events with well-documented outcomes.

## Validation Scenarios

### 1. COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2023)

**Setup:**
```
Initialize: 2020 state (population 7.8B, AI capability 0.3)
Trigger: Pandemic event (2-5M deaths)
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Tech company revenue: +20-40% (Google, Amazon, Microsoft)
- Remote work adoption: 30-50%
- Vaccine development: 12-18 months
- Economic recovery: 2021-2022
- Population impact: <0.1% mortality

**Test:** Does simulation match observed trajectory?

### 2. 2008 Financial Crisis

**Setup:**
```
Initialize: 2008 state
Trigger: Market crash (housing bubble)
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 10-30% organizational bankruptcies (not 100%)
- Government bailouts (TARP)
- Recovery by 2010-2012
- Tech sector resilient (Apple, Google survived)

**Test:** Does simulation match organizational survival rates?

### 3. Black Death (1347-1353)

**Setup:**
```
Initialize: Medieval population/tech (adjust parameters to 1347 levels)
Trigger: Pandemic (30-60% mortality over 6 years)
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Population: 75M → 45M → 78M by 1450
- Recovery: 1% annual growth post-crisis
- Economic changes: Wages increase, labor scarcity

**Test:** Does simulation show recovery (not extinction)?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] COVID-19: Matches mortality (<0.1%), tech growth (+20-40%), recovery timeline
- [ ] 2008 Crisis: Organizational survival 70-90%, recovery by 2012
- [ ] Black Death: 30-60% mortality, full recovery within 100 years

## Implementation

Create validation test suite:

```bash
npm run validate:covid19
npm run validate:2008crisis
npm run validate:blackdeath
```

Each validation run should:
1. Initialize to historical state
2. Trigger historical event
3. Compare simulation outcomes to historical data
4. Report accuracy metrics
