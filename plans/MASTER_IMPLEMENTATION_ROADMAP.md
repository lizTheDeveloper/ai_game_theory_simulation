# Master Implementation Roadmap
## AI Alignment Game Theory Simulation

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Updated)
**Purpose:** Active work items and future features - all completed work archived
**Priority:** Mechanism-driven realism, not balance tuning

---

## PHILOSOPHY: Research-Backed Realism

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Research First:** Every mechanic backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research
2. **Mechanisms Over Balance:** Set parameters to real-world values, don't tune for "fun"
3. **Emergence:** Allow unexpected outcomes to emerge from interactions
4. **Documentation:** Every system has research citations

---

**Expected Impact:**
- Expands outcome space beyond Utopia/Dystopia/Extinction
- Realism (BCI development is happening)
- Philosophical depth (what is "human"?)

## RESEARCH DOCUMENTATION STANDARD

Every mechanic must have:

1. **Research Citations:** 2+ peer-reviewed sources (2024-2025 preferred)
2. **Parameter Justification:** Why this number? (not "feels right")
3. **Mechanism Description:** How does it work? (not just effects)
4. **Interaction Map:** What does it affect/affected by?
5. **Expected Timeline:** When does it matter? (early/mid/late game)
6. **Failure Modes:** What can go wrong?
7. **Test Validation:** Monte Carlo evidence it works

---

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### For Each Feature:

1. **Research Phase:** Tavily search for 2024-2025 research, create plan with citations
2. **Design Phase:** Define state structure, mechanics, interactions
3. **Implementation Phase:** Create module, integrate, add logging, write tests
4. **Validation Phase:** Run Monte Carlo (N=10 minimum), review logs
5. **Documentation Phase:** Update wiki, devlog, roadmap, commit

---

## BALANCE PHILOSOPHY

**NO TUNING FOR "FUN" - Let the model show what it shows**

The model is a research tool, not a game balance problem.

**Questions to ask:**
1. Are extinction mechanisms research-backed?
2. Are mitigation pathways realistic?
3. Do outcomes emerge from mechanics?
4. Can we explain why each outcome happened?

**If model shows 90% extinction → DOCUMENT WHY**
**If model shows 50% Utopia → DOCUMENT WHY**
