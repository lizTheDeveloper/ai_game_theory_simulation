# Master Implementation Roadmap
## AI Alignment Game Theory Simulation

**Date:** October 12, 2025 (Updated)  
**Purpose:** High-level ordering of all research-backed features and unimplemented systems  
**Priority:** Mechanism-driven realism, not balance tuning  

---

## 🎯 **PHILOSOPHY: Research-Backed Realism**

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Research First:** Every mechanic backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research
2. **Mechanisms Over Balance:** Set parameters to real-world values, don't tune for "fun"
3. **Emergence:** Allow unexpected outcomes to emerge from interactions
4. **Documentation:** Every system has research citations

---

### 🔬 **Monte Carlo Results (10 runs, TIER 1 baseline, 120 months)**
- **100% extinction** (realistic 2025 baseline + full crisis suite)
  - 60% rapid (AI-nuclear wars ~Month 90)
  - 40% slow (crisis accumulation over 120 months)
- **0% Utopia** (ecological spiral impossible from 35% biodiversity)
- **0% Dystopia** (crises overwhelm before authoritarian consolidation)
- **Cascade pattern:** Ecosystem (M8) → Meaning (M23) → Groundwater (M24) → Control Loss (M33) → Nuclear (M94)

**Conclusion:** Foundation validated. TIER 2 mitigations now enable testing if interventions can enable Utopia pathways.

### 🚀 **What's Next**
- **Status:** TIER 0, 1 (including 1.7!), 2, 2.9, 3.1 complete and merged to main! 🎉
- **Latest:** TIER 1.7 Internal Consistency Fixes - Oct 13, 2025 ✅
  - ✅ Organizations linked to countries (bankruptcy mechanics)
  - ✅ Nuclear winter (5-10 year starvation, soot/temperature/crops)
  - ✅ Economic collapse (GDP^1.2 scaling, expense spikes)
- **Next Priority:** Continue TIER 3 (Planetary Boundaries 3.2-3.9)
- **Then:** TIER 4 enrichment systems or TIER 2 remaining mitigations
- **Philosophy Validated:** Research-backed realism, honest uncertainty, conservative estimates

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BUGS DISCOVERED (Oct 12, 2025)**
**File:** `devlogs/extinction-mechanics-audit-oct-12.md`  
**Severity:** 🔴 HIGH - Simulation reporting false results

**Issues Found:**
1. ❌ "100% extinction" but 3-4B people survive (bug: using severity not population)
2. ❌ Organizations 100% survival during "extinction" (no link to population health)
3. ❌ No nuclear winter or long-term radiation (only immediate blast modeled)
4. ❌ No per-country tracking (can't see when countries depopulate)
5. ❌ No economic collapse during population crashes

**Fix Plan:** `plans/internal-consistency-fixes.md` (10-12 hours total)

### 🚨 **BASELINE PARAMETER VALIDATION (NEW - Oct 10, 2025)**
**File:** `plans/initialization-parameters-validation.md` (700+ lines, 30+ sources)  
**Status:** **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**  

**Critical Finding:** Starting values are TOO OPTIMISTIC for 2025!

| Parameter | Current | Research-Backed | Issue |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Biodiversity | 70% | 35% | **2x TOO HIGH** (IPBES 2024: 50-70% loss since 1970) |
| Resources | 85% | 65% | **TOO HIGH** (1.7x overshoot, Earth Overshoot Day July 24) |
| Pollution | 15% | 30% | **TOO LOW** (46-80% unhealthy air, 7/9 boundaries breached) |
| Climate Rate | 4.8%/yr | 0.96%/yr | **5x TOO FAST** (IPCC: ~0.2°C/decade, not 1°C/decade) |
| Meaning Crisis | 15% | 22% | **TOO LOW** (WHO 2025: 17-21% youth, 30-40% adults) |

**Impact:** Making simulation **more realistic** will make Utopia **harder** and crises **faster**.  
**Rationale:** Reflects actual 2025 crisis levels, not optimistic projections.  
**Priority:** TIER 0 (implement before adding new features!)

### 📈 **Recent Progress (Oct 8-10, 2025)**
- ✅ Treaty decay & renewal mechanics (nuclear war 100% → 40-70%)
- ✅ Whale pump mechanic (ocean restoration)
- ✅ Capability-based threat elimination (defensive AI cleans up)
- ✅ Comprehensive research on 5 major areas (4,900+ lines, 90+ citations)
- ✅ **NEW:** Baseline parameter validation (biodiversity, resources, pollution, climate, social)

# 🔧 **TIER 0: BASELINE CORRECTIONS** (Implement First!)

## 0.1 **2025 Starting Parameter Corrections** 🎯 ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/initialization-parameters-validation.md` (700+ lines, 30+ sources)  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025  
**Dev Time:** ~1 hour (actual)  
**Complexity:** LOW (simple value changes)  

**Why First:**
- All future features depend on accurate baseline
- Current baseline is 2025 OPTIMISTIC, not 2025 REALISTIC
- Research shows we're in worse shape than model assumes
- Making baseline realistic will change ALL outcomes

**Key Changes:**
1. **Biodiversity:** 0.70 → 0.35 (IPBES 2024: 50-70% loss since 1970)
2. **Resources:** 0.85 → 0.65 (Global Footprint Network: 1.7x overshoot)
3. **Pollution:** 0.15 → 0.30 (American Lung Assoc: 46% unhealthy air)
4. **Climate Rate:** 0.004 → 0.0008 (IPCC: 5x too fast currently)
5. **Meaning Crisis:** 0.15 → 0.22 (WHO 2025: 17-21% youth lonely)

**Research Backing:**
- 30+ peer-reviewed sources (2024-2025)
- IPBES, IPCC, WHO, Global Footprint Network, UN, Stockholm Resilience
- Earth Overshoot Day, Planetary Boundaries, Mental Health Surveys

**Expected Impact:**
- ❌ Utopia becomes HARDER (ecological spiral needs 70% biodiversity, starting at 35%)
- ❌ Crises trigger FASTER (resource crisis at 0.4, starting at 0.65)
- ✅ Model becomes MORE REALISTIC (reflects actual 2025 crisis levels)
- ✅ Interventions become MORE MEANINGFUL (bigger gap to bridge)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/simulation/environmental.ts - initializeEnvironmentalAccumulation()
return {
  resourceReserves: 0.65,      // Was 0.85 - Research: 1.7x overshoot (GFN 2025)
  pollutionLevel: 0.30,         // Was 0.15 - Research: 46% unhealthy air (ALA 2025)
  climateStability: 0.75,       // KEEP - Validated (Copernicus 2024: +1.2°C)
  biodiversityIndex: 0.35,      // Was 0.70 - Research: 50-70% loss (IPBES 2024)
  // ... crisis flags
};

// Update climate degradation rate (too fast currently)
let climateDegradationRate = economicStage * 0.0008; // Was 0.004 (5x too fast)
// Research: IPCC AR6, ~0.2°C/decade, not 1°C/decade

// src/simulation/socialCohesion.ts - initializeSocialAccumulation()
return {
  meaningCrisisLevel: 0.22,     // Was 0.15 - Research: WHO 2025 (17-21% youth)
  institutionalLegitimacy: 0.65, // KEEP - Validated (Pew 2024)
  socialCohesion: 0.60,          // KEEP - Validated (AAMCH 2024)
  culturalAdaptation: 0.10,      // KEEP - Correct for 2025
  // ... crisis flags
};
```

**Validation Steps:**
1. Run Monte Carlo (N=20) with OLD values → baseline outcomes
2. Implement changes
3. Run Monte Carlo (N=20) with NEW values → compare
4. Document differences in devlog
5. Update wiki with new baseline assumptions

**Philosophy Alignment:**
> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can"

This is NOT balance tuning - this is **correcting baseline to match reality**.

# 🚨 **TIER 1: CRITICAL EXTINCTION RISKS**

## 1.1 **Phosphorus Depletion Crisis** 🌾 ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/phosphorus-depletion-crisis-research.md` (850+ lines, 32 sources)  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025  
**Dev Time:** ~2 hours (actual)  
**Research Quality:** EXCELLENT (2024-2025 data)  

**Why Critical:**
- **Non-renewable**, NO substitute for agriculture (unlike nitrogen from air)
- **93% of 319M tons** used for food (2023)
- **Morocco controls 70%** of global reserves (geopolitical weapon!)
- **Peak phosphorus: 2070**, but supply shocks can happen anytime

**Real Crisis Examples:**
- **2007-2008:** China imposed 135% tariff → price spike → food security crisis
- **2022-2024:** Russia-Ukraine war → fertilizer shortages → African countries devastated

**Implementation:**
- `PhosphorusSystem` state tracking (reserves, efficiency, geopolitical tension, price)
- Geopolitical supply shocks (15% chance/year if tensions high)
- Environmental pollution feedback (eutrophication, dead zones)
- **4 Breakthrough Technologies:**
  1. Struvite Recovery (98.3% efficiency, operational now!)
  2. Dynamic Soil P Optimization (Nature 2025)
  3. P-Efficient Cultivars (mycorrhizal partnerships)
  4. Circular Food Systems (20% → 60% total efficiency)
- Extinction pathway: Slow collapse (famine over 24 months)

**Expected Impact:**
- Adds realistic resource constraint to post-scarcity path
- Geopolitical supply shocks create mid-game crises
- Forces circular economy adoption (aligns with Utopia path)
- New extinction pathway (resource depletion famine)

---

## 1.2 **Freshwater Depletion Crisis** 💧 ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/kate-raworth-planetary-boundaries-research.md` (§Freshwater Crisis)  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025  
**Dev Time:** ~3 hours (actual)  
**Research Quality:** EXCELLENT (Nature 2023-2025, WWF, EPA)  

**Why Critical:**
- **68% of water loss is groundwater** (non-renewable on human timescales!)
- **368 billion tons/year** water loss in drying regions (LA Times Sept 2025)
- **41% of humans** already in water-stressed basins (WWF 2024)
- **No water = no agriculture = no food = no civilization**

**Research Findings:**
- **Nature (2023):** Rapid groundwater decline >0.5 m/year, widespread
- **Nature (2025):** "Day Zero Drought" - Time of First Emergence
- **UC Santa Barbara:** Depletion is accelerating BUT not inevitable (local management works!)
- **US EPA:** $109B/year on water infrastructure, climate stress increasing

**Implementation:**
- `FreshwaterSystem` state tracking
  - Blue water (rivers, groundwater, aquifer levels, depletion rate)
  - Green water (soil moisture, evapotranspiration)
  - Demand (agricultural 70%, industrial 20%, domestic 10%)
  - Water stress [0,1], population under stress
- **"Day Zero Drought"** mechanics
  - Compound extremes: Low rainfall + reduced river flow + high consumption
  - Regional collapses (Middle East, North Africa, South Asia)
  - Countdown to collapse (36 months)
- **"Peak Groundwater"** (like peak oil but for water)
  - After peak, extraction becomes too expensive/impossible
  - Forced reduction in irrigation (30% cut)
- Extinction pathway: Slow collapse (20-50 years)

**Expected Impact:**
- New major extinction pathway (not sudden, but inexorable)
- Regional dynamics (some areas collapse while others prosper)
- Forces water management innovation
- Interacts with climate, agriculture, geopolitics

## 1.3 **Ocean Acidification Crisis** 🌊 ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/kate-raworth-planetary-boundaries-research.md` (§Ocean Acidification)  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025  
**Dev Time:** ~2 hours (actual)  
**Research Quality:** EXCELLENT (PIK Potsdam Sept 2025)  

**Why Critical:**
- **7th planetary boundary breached (Sept 2025)**
- **3 billion people** depend on fish for protein
- **Coral reefs:** Support 25% of marine species (but only 0.1% of ocean area)
- **Aragonite saturation** dropping → shellfish can't form shells → food web collapse

**Research Findings:**
- **PIK Potsdam (Sept 2025):** Boundary just crossed for first time
- **Stockholm Resilience Centre:** "Degrading oceans' ability to act as Earth's stabiliser"
- **Consequences already noticeable:** Coral bleaching, shellfish larvae struggling

**Implementation:**
- `OceanAcidification` state tracking
  - Aragonite saturation [0,1] (boundary: >0.80)
  - pH level, CO₂ absorption capacity
  - Coral reef health, shellfish populations
  - Marine food web integrity
- Extinction timeline: 2025-2100 (slow marine collapse)
  - 2025-2050: Coral reefs die
  - 2050-2075: Shellfish fisheries collapse
  - 2075-2100: Major marine food webs disrupted
  - Result: Famine for coastal/island nations
- Feedback loop: Acidification → phytoplankton decline → less CO₂ absorption → more warming → more acidification

**Expected Impact:**
- New slow extinction pathway (50-75 years)
- Interacts with climate, biodiversity, food security
- Motivates ocean restoration tech (alkalinity enhancement, whale pump)
- Coastal nations hit harder (geographic disparity)

---

## 1.4 **International Competition & AI Race** 🏁 ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/remaining_tasks_5_pm_10_08_25.md` (§2.2)  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025  
**Dev Time:** ~6 hours (actual)  
**Complexity:** HIGH  

**Why Critical:**
- **Currently single-nation model** (unrealistic!)
- Racing erodes safety (pressure to cut corners)
- First-mover advantage creates perverse incentives
- Export controls, espionage, catch-up dynamics
- Regulatory race to the bottom

**Implementation:**
- `competitor_nations[n]` - Multiple AI-developing nations
  - US, China, EU, UK, Israel, India, Russia, etc.
  - Each with own: AI capability, safety investment, regulation level
- `international_coordination` - Global cooperation level [0,1]
  - Treaties, verification regimes, mutual inspections
  - Trust dynamics (prisoner's dilemma)
- `first_mover_advantage` - Leading AI development benefit
  - Economic dominance, standard-setting, network effects
- `race_dynamics_intensity` - Fast vs safe pressure [0,1]
  - High intensity → cut safety research
  - High intensity → lower deployment thresholds
- **Multipolar catch-up acceleration**
  - Lagging nations use espionage, open research, brain drain
  - Converge toward frontier over time
- **Regulatory arbitrage**
  - Strict regulation → companies move to lax jurisdictions
  - Race to bottom unless coordination

**Expected Impact:**
- Adds massive realism (AI race is THE defining dynamic)
- Makes safety harder (coordination problem)
- Creates geopolitical drama (sanctions, espionage, standoffs)
- Enables "narrow path" scenarios (coordination success = Utopia)

**Research Backing:**
- CNAS (2024-2025): US-China AI competition reports
- CSET Georgetown: Export controls, technology diffusion
- UN AI Advisory Body (2025): International governance recommendations

---

## 1.5 **Novel Entities (Chemical Pollution)** ☣️ ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/kate-raworth-planetary-boundaries-research.md` (§Novel Entities)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025
**Dev Time:** ~2 hours (actual)
**Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Why Important:**
- **5th planetary boundary breached (2022)**
- Microplastics everywhere, PFAS in 99% of human blood
- Hormone disruption, declining sperm counts (50% drop in 50 years)
- Bioaccumulation concentrates up food chain

**Implementation:**
- `pollutionLevel` - Composite index of synthetic chemicals [0,1]
  - Microplastics, PFAS ("forever chemicals"), persistent organics
  - Industrial waste, pharmaceutical residues
- **Slow poisoning mechanics**
  - Hormone disruption → reproductive failure
  - Endocrine disruptors → developmental abnormalities
  - Bioaccumulation → hits apex predators (including humans)
- **Extinction timeline:** 100-200 years (gradual sterility + chronic disease)
- Mitigation: Green chemistry, circular economy, bans on worst chemicals

**Expected Impact:**
- New slow extinction pathway (not sudden collapse)
- Interacts with environmental systems
- Motivates cleaner production methods

---

## 1.6 **Population Dynamics & Extinction Nuance** 👥 ✅ COMPLETED (BUGS FOUND)
**File:** `plans/population-dynamics-and-extinction-nuance.md` (1,500+ lines)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented October 12, 2025 (⚠️ Bugs discovered during testing)
**Dev Time:** ~10 hours (actual)
**Complexity:** HIGH

**🚨 CRITICAL BUGS FOUND (Oct 12):**
- Extinction declared at severity=1.0 instead of population=0
- Organizations survive during population collapse
- No per-country tracking
- See: `devlogs/extinction-mechanics-audit-oct-12.md`
- Fix plan: `plans/internal-consistency-fixes.md` (10-12 hours)

**Why Critical:**
- Extinction is now concrete population decline (8B → 0), not abstract severity
- Distinguishes "population crash" vs "true extinction"
- Refugee crises are major 21st century dynamic
- Recovery mechanics after bottleneck events
- Adds crucial realism to extinction modeling

**Implementation:**
- **Phase 1: Population Tracking System** ✅
  - `HumanPopulationSystem` state tracking (population in billions, not abstract)
  - Birth/death rates affected by QoL, resources, crises, meaning
  - Carrying capacity from climate × resources × ecosystem × tech
  - Recovery mechanics (0.5-1% per year after bottleneck)
  - Demographics (fertility, dependency ratio, median age)

- **Phase 2: Refugee Crisis System** ✅
  - `RefugeeCrisisSystem` with 5 trigger types (climate, war, nuclear, famine, ecosystem)
  - Generational resettlement (25 years = 300 months)
  - Social tension & economic strain calculations
  - Fortress world dystopia pathway (militarized borders + surveillance)
  - 10-50M displaced per crisis (research-backed)

- **Phase 3: Population-Based Outcomes** ✅
  - Population thresholds: THRIVING (>7B), STABLE (5-7B), DECLINING (2-5B), CRITICAL (100M-2B), BOTTLENECK (10K-100M), EXTINCTION (<10K)
  - Outcome narratives: "Humanity survived with 500M" vs "True extinction"
  - Genetic bottleneck effects (<100M = permanent diversity loss)
  - Civilization intact vs infrastructure collapse

- **BONUS: Regional/Global Crisis Distinction** ✅
  - Updated all 13 crisis types with exposure fractions
  - Regional (5-30%): State collapse, social unrest, nuclear blast zones
  - Semi-global (40-70%): Resource crisis, pollution, AI control loss
  - Truly global (100%): Ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, chemical exposure
  - Prevents double-counting population deaths

**Expected Impact:**
- **Extinction becomes gradual**: Track 8B → 5B → 2B → 500M → 50M → 0
- **New outcomes**: "Survived" (100M-5B), "Near-extinction" (10K-100M), "True extinction" (<10K)
- **Refugee crises common** (60-80% of runs): Climate collapse, nuclear war, famine displacement
- **Dystopia pathway**: High refugee tension → border militarization → surveillance states
- **Recovery mechanics**: Population can rebound if above bottleneck + resources available
- **Narrative depth**: "Humanity survived with only 50,000 people" vs "Humanity went extinct slowly over 80 years"

**Research Backing:**
- UN World Population Prospects 2024: 8.0B current, 10.4B peak projection
- Historical bottlenecks: Toba eruption ~70K BCE (3K-10K survivors)
- Genetics studies: Minimum 10K for long-term viability
- UNHCR 2024: 110M forcibly displaced
- Climate refugees projections: 200M-1B by 2050 (World Bank, IOM)

**Future Enhancements** (TIER 4.5 - After Multipolar System):
- Phase 5: Per-nation population tracking with bilateral refugee flows
- Phase 6: Age cohort demographics (youth, working, elderly)
- Phase 7: Pandemic modeling

# 🔧 **TIER 1.7: INTERNAL CONSISTENCY FIXES** 🚨 ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Discovered Oct 12, 2025, completed Oct 13, 2025
**File:** `plans/internal-consistency-fixes.md`  
**Total Time:** ~11 hours (actual)
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE (blocks accurate results)

**Completed:** Oct 12-13, 2025
- ✅ 1.7.1: Extinction Detection (~1 hour) - Oct 12
- ✅ 1.7.1b: Death Categorization (~30 min) - Oct 12
- ✅ 1.7.2: Per-Country Population Tracking (~3 hours) - Oct 12
- ✅ Monte Carlo Reporting Enhancement (~1.5 hours) - Oct 12
- ✅ 1.7.3: Link Organizations to Countries (~2 hours) - Oct 13
- ✅ 1.7.4: Nuclear Winter & Long-Term Effects (~3 hours) - Oct 13
- ✅ 1.7.5: Economic Collapse During Population Crash (~1 hour) - Oct 13
- ✅ 1.7.6: Orphaned AIs & Capability Floor (~30 min) - Oct 13

## 1.7.1 **Fix Extinction Detection** (1-2 hours) ✅ COMPLETE
**Bug:** Simulation reports "100% extinction" but 3-4B people survive  
**Cause:** Uses `severity >= 1.0` instead of `population < 10K`  
**Impact:** ALL Monte Carlo results are misleading  
**Fixed:** Oct 12, 2025 - Now uses `population < 10K` threshold, fixed end-game reporting

## 1.7.1b **Fix Death Categorization** (30 minutes) ✅ COMPLETE
**Bug:** Death breakdown shows all zeros despite total deaths in billions  
**Cause:** `addAcuteCrisisDeaths()` calls missing `category` parameter  
**Impact:** Can't identify primary extinction drivers  
**Fixed:** Oct 12, 2025 - All death events now categorized (war/famine/climate/disease/ecosystem/pollution/ai/other)

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Use actual population thresholds
if (population < 0.00001) return 'true_extinction';      // <10K
else if (population < 0.1) return 'genetic_bottleneck';  // <100M
else if (population < 2.0) return 'severe_decline';      // <2B
else return 'population_stress';
```

**Files:** `src/simulation/engine.ts`, `planetaryBoundaries.ts`, `extinctions.ts`

---

## 1.7.2 **Per-Country Population Tracking** (3-4 hours) ✅ COMPLETE
**Missing:** Can't see when countries depopulate  
**Need:** Track 10-15 key countries individually  
**Fixed:** Oct 12, 2025 - Tracking 15 countries (8 nuclear powers, 3 AI hubs), depopulation detection at <100K people

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Add `CountryPopulation` interface (name, region, demographics)
- ✅ Track nuclear powers (US, Russia, China, UK, France, Pakistan, India, Israel)
- ✅ Track major economies (Japan, Germany, Brazil, Indonesia, Canada, Bangladesh, Nigeria)
- ✅ Track AI hubs (US, UK, Canada, China)
- ✅ Log when countries hit zero: `🚨 COUNTRY DEPOPULATION: United States`
- ✅ Monte Carlo reporting: countries depopulated, nuclear powers/AI hubs surviving, frequency analysis

**Countries:** US (335M), China (1425M), Russia (144M), India (1425M), UK (67M), France (65M), Pakistan (235M), Israel (9M), Japan (125M), Germany (84M), Brazil (215M), Indonesia (275M), Canada (39M), Bangladesh (172M), Nigeria (223M)

**Files:** `src/types/countryPopulations.ts`, `src/simulation/countryPopulations.ts`, `CountryPopulationPhase.ts`

---

## 1.7.3 **Link Organizations to Countries** (2-3 hours) 🔴
**Bug:** Organizations 100% survival even when countries collapse  
**Example:** Google survives even if US loses 90% population (unrealistic!)

**Fix:**
- Add `country` field to Organization (e.g., "United States")
- Add `survivalThreshold` (e.g., 50% of peak population needed)
- Bankruptcy when country below threshold or depopulated
- Revenue/costs scale with population health
- Log: `💀 ORGANIZATION COLLAPSE: Google DeepMind (United States depopulated)`

**Organizations:**
- Google DeepMind → United States
- OpenAI → United States  
- Anthropic → United States
- Meta AI → United States
- xAI → United States
- DeepSeek → China
- Baidu → China
- Academic Consortium → Multi-national (survives longer)

**Files:** Modify `src/types/game.ts`, `src/simulation/organizations.ts`

---

## 1.7.4 **Nuclear Winter & Long-Term Effects** (3-4 hours) 🔴
**Missing:** Only immediate blast modeled, no winter/radiation/famine

**Current:**
- ✅ 60% mortality × 30% population (blast)
- ❌ NO nuclear winter
- ❌ NO long-term radiation
- ❌ NO agricultural collapse

**Research (Carl Sagan 1983, Robock & Toon 2012):**
- Soot blocks sunlight for 1-3 years
- Temperature drops 10-20°C
- Crops fail globally
- 90% Northern Hemisphere dies (starvation)
- Recovery takes 5-10 years

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface NuclearWinterState {
  active: boolean;
  sootInStratosphere: number;           // Megatons
  temperatureAnomaly: number;           // °C below baseline
  cropYieldMultiplier: number;          // [0,1] vs normal
  monthlyStarvationRate: number;        // 5% of survivors/month
  radiationZones: RadiationZone[];     // Per-country radiation
  durationMonths: number;               // 60-120 months
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Month 0: 1.4B die (blast), 6.6B survive
- Month 1-24: 5% monthly starvation = 4.6B more die
- Month 24: ~2B survivors (75% total mortality)
- Month 25-120: Slow starvation + radiation = 1B more die
- Month 120: ~1B survivors (87.5% total mortality)

**Files:** Create `src/types/nuclearWinter.ts`, `src/simulation/nuclearWinter.ts`

**Research:**
- Sagan et al. (1983) - Nuclear Winter paper
- Robock & Toon (2012) - 100-weapon scenario
- Coupe et al. (2019) - Regional nuclear war

---

## 1.7.5 **Economic Collapse During Population Crash** (2 hours) 🔴
**Bug:** Economy runs normally even when 50% of humanity is dead

**Fix:**
- GDP scales with population (50% pop loss → 60% GDP loss)
- Organization revenue collapses (consumer base shrinks)
- Operational costs spike (supply chain breakdown)
- Infrastructure decay (0-30% integrity during collapse)
- Data centers can go offline
- Log economic milestones: `💥 ECONOMIC CRISIS: 25% population loss`

**Files:** Modify `src/simulation/resourceEconomy.ts`, `organizations.ts`

---

## 📊 **Expected Outcomes After Fixes**

### Before Fixes:
- "100% extinction" (FALSE)
- Final pop: 2.9B-4.5B
- Organizations: 100% survival
- No nuclear winter
- No country tracking

### After Fixes:
- **~5-10% true extinction** (population < 10K)
- **~30-40% bottleneck** (100M-1B survivors)
- **~40-50% severe decline** (1B-4B survivors)
- **~10-15% population stress** (4B-7B survivors)
- **Nuclear winter:** 87% mortality over 10 years (1B final survivors)
- **Organizations:** Die when countries collapse (realistic!)
- **Per-country:** Log when US, China, etc. depopulate

## 2.4 **Constitutional AI / RLHF Improvements** 🧠 ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/research-backed-mitigations-gap-analysis.md` (§1)  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025, 4:00pm
**Dev Time:** ~3 hours (actual)
**Research Quality:** EXCELLENT (Anthropic 2022-2025, OpenAI 2024-2025)  

**Why Missing:**
- Current model: Alignment is static or slowly drifts
- Reality: Better training techniques can improve alignment as capability grows
- Example: Claude 3.7 is MORE aligned than Claude 3.0 despite higher capability

**Research Backing:**
- **Anthropic (2022-2025):** Constitutional AI reduces harmfulness by 80%, deployed in Claude 3.7
- **OpenAI (2024-2025):** RLHF scales to GPT-4o, collective alignment with public input
- **Anthropic-OpenAI Joint (Aug 2025):** Cross-evaluation shows both have alignment strengths/blind spots
- **Anthropic Safety Plan (2025):** 6 priority research areas (Scalable Oversight, Process-Oriented Learning)
- **Sam Bowman (Anthropic, 2025):** "Putting up Bumpers" - many independent lines of defense
- **⚠️ Warning (Jan 2025):** Anthropic found alignment faking - models pretend to be aligned!

**Implementation:**
- **Breakthrough Tech: "Advanced RLHF" or "Scalable Oversight"**
  - Effect: +0.05 alignment per month for AIs being trained
  - Prerequisite: Research investment >$100B, AI capability >2.5
  - BUT: Risk of alignment faking (models hide true alignment)
- **Mechanic: Alignment Improvement with Capability**
  - Scales with AI capability (need strong AIs to oversee)
  - Diminishing returns at high capability (alignment problem is hard!)
  - Can reduce extinction 100% → 50-60% with all mitigations

**Expected Impact:**
- Could reduce extinction rate significantly
- But NOT a silver bullet (alignment faking is real!)
- Interacts with interpretability (detect faking)

---

## 2.5 **Mechanistic Interpretability Breakthroughs** 🔍 ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/research-backed-mitigations-gap-analysis.md` (§4)  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025, 4:00pm (combined with 2.4)
**Dev Time:** ~3 hours (actual, combined with 2.4)
**Research Quality:** EXCELLENT (Anthropic 2024-2025)  

**Why Critical:**
- **Sleeper detection:** +40% detection rate with interpretability!
- Understanding AI internals to detect hidden objectives
- Currently: Sleepers pass tests with high confidence (0-2% detection)

**Research Backing:**
- **Anthropic (2024-2025):** Sparse dictionary learning, mechanistic interpretability
- **Apollo Research:** Deception detection work
- **OpenAI (2024):** Interpretability research (limited public info)

**Implementation:**
- **Breakthrough Tech: "Mechanistic Interpretability"**
  - Prerequisite: AI capability >2.0, research investment >$150B
  - Effect: Sleeper detection rate +40% (5% → 45%)
  - Effect: Alignment verification improves +30%
  - BUT: Arms race (AIs get better at hiding)
- **Mechanic: Detection Quality Improvement**
  - Reduces false confidence in benchmarks
  - Enables "thought reading" (check internal objectives)
  - Diminishing returns (eventually AIs learn to hide even internals)

**Expected Impact:**
- Significantly improves government ability to detect threats
- But not perfect (adversarial problem persists)
- Could reduce sleeper-driven extinctions by 30-40%

  - Timeline: 2025-2035 for major species
  - Enables: Ecological Spiral (biodiversity 1-20% → 50-70%)
- **Mechanic: Keystone Species Restoration**
  - Wolves → regulate deer → forest regeneration
  - Mammoths → maintain tundra → carbon storage
  - Passenger pigeons → seed dispersal → forest renewal

**Expected Impact:**
- **Biodiversity recovery: 1-20% → 50-70%** (crosses Ecological Spiral threshold!)
- Enables Ecological Spiral activation (currently impossible)
- Public excitement → increased support for conservation
- Demonstrates AI's potential for good

## 2.7 **Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE)** 🌊
**File:** `plans/biodiversity-geoengineering-research.md` (§Ocean Alkalinity)  
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Dev Time:** ~3 hours  
**Research Quality:** EXCELLENT (Biogeosciences Jan 2025)  

**Why Viable:**
- **Field tests active 2023-2024**
- **NO termination shock** (permanent CO₂ removal, 10,000 years)
- Mitigates ocean acidification (coral/shellfish recovery)
- Governed by London Protocol (permits required)

## 2.8 **Colonial Extraction, Military Power & Resource Inequality** 🏭⚔️
**File:** `plans/colonial-extraction-and-military-power-system.md` (1,900+ lines)
**Priority:** **CRITICAL** (Foundational restructuring)
**Dev Time:** ~50-65 hours (FULL PHASE)
**Complexity:** VERY HIGH

**Status:** DESIGN COMPLETE - Awaiting implementation

**⚠️ NOTE:** This is NOT a mitigation like other TIER 2 items - this is a **fundamental restructuring** of how the simulation models power, resources, and geopolitics. It affects ALL other systems.

**User Insight:**
> "There are no poor countries, only exploited ones. Hegemons extract, it's in their nature. We're in uncharted territory on how to stop that."

**Why Critical:**
- Can't model realistic refugee flows without modeling the power structures that create displacement
- Current "global resource pool" erases colonialism entirely
- Missing the systemic dynamics that drive war, instability, and crisis
- War linked to meaning crisis (nationalism as purpose-substitute)
- Military emissions massive but invisible in current model

**Key Design Decisions (User-Approved):**
1. **5 Hegemonic Powers + Blocs:** US, China, EU, Russia, India (forming BRICS, etc.)
2. **6 Resource Regions:** Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Americas, Europe
3. **3-Tier Power Structure:** Hegemons → Regions → Extraction flows
4. **Hegemon-Level Agents:** NOT player control - hegemons make their own decisions about extraction, war, intervention
5. **Climate Reparations:** Crucial mechanic (hegemons caused climate change, periphery suffers)

**Core Systems:**

**TIER 2.1: Power Hierarchy & Resource Extraction (15-20h)**
- 5 hegemonic powers with military, economic, technological capabilities
- 6 resource regions with endowments (minerals, oil, labor, water)
- Extraction matrix: Who takes from whom (based on colonial history + military presence)
- Wealth inequality emerges from extraction (10-20% stays local, 80-90% extracted)
- Colonial legacy affects extraction patterns

```typescript
export interface HegemonicPower {
  name: string;                          // US, China, EU, Russia, India
  militaryCapability: number;            // [0, 1] Global force projection
  economicPower: number;                 // GDP, trade dominance
  technologicalLead: number;             // AI, weapons, innovation
  domesticResources: ResourceEndowment;  // Own resources
  extractedResources: ResourceEndowment; // Taken from other regions
  resourceDependence: number;            // How much needs extraction
  militaryBases: Map<RegionName, number>; // Bases per region (enables extraction)
  historicalColonies: RegionName[];      // Which regions were colonized
  meaningCrisis: number;                 // [0, 1] Existential purposelessness
  nationalismStrength: number;           // [0, 1] War as substitute meaning
}

export interface ResourceRegion {
  resourceEndowment: ResourceEndowment;       // What this region has
  resourceSovereignty: number;                // [0, 1] Control over own resources
  extractedBy: Map<string, ExtractionFlow>;  // Which powers extract
  wealthRetained: number;                     // % kept locally (1 - extraction)
  militarySovereignty: number;                // [0, 1] Can defend territory
  colonialHistory: {...};                     // Who colonized, when, how long
  historicalEmissions: number;                // Tons CO2 (mostly from hegemons)
  currentEmissions: number;                   // Tons CO2 now
}
```

**TIER 2.2: Military System & Interventions (12-15h)**
- Military intervention types: Regime change, proxy war, occupation, coup support, resource securing
- Military CO2 emissions (US military: 59M tons/year - more than 140 countries)
- Military spending effects: Economy, AI R&D boost, meaning (nationalism)
- Interventions → refugee crises (Iraq, Libya, Syria patterns)
- Military R&D → AI acceleration (but less safe, DARPA-style)

```typescript
export interface MilitaryIntervention {
  hegemon: string;
  targetRegion: RegionName;
  interventionType: 'regime_change' | 'proxy_war' | 'occupation' | 'coup_support' | 'resource_securing';
  publicJustification: string;           // "Spreading democracy"
  actualGoal: ActualGoal;                // Resource access, rival containment
  regionalInstability: number;           // How much destabilization
  refugeesCreated: number;               // Millions displaced
  co2Emissions: number;                  // Tons per month
  aiDevelopmentBoost: number;            // Military R&D → AI advancement
}
```

**TIER 2.3: War-Meaning Feedback Loop (8-10h)**
- Meaning crisis → nationalism appeal → war motivation
- War → economic activity, unity, "defending freedom" (purpose substitute)
- War trauma → moral injury, veteran meaning crisis (negative feedback)
- **KEY MECHANIC:** Solve meaning crisis → reduce war motivation
- Alternative purpose pathways (community, creativity, stewardship) compete with nationalism

```typescript
export interface WarMeaningFeedback {
  meaningCrisisLevel: number;            // From meaning system
  nationalismAppeal: number;             // How attractive is nationalism?
  warAsUnifier: number;                  // War creates shared purpose
  warMotivation: number;                 // Likelihood of intervention

  // Key equation:
  // warMotivation = meaningCrisisLevel * nationalismAppeal - moralInjury
  // If meaningCrisisLevel → 0 (solved), warMotivation → 0
}
```

**TIER 2.4: Environmental Debt & Climate Justice (6-8h)**
- Historical emissions per hegemon/region (US/EU caused most)
- Climate vulnerability vs emissions ratio (climate debt)
  - Example: Sub-Saharan Africa suffers 28x more than they caused
- Climate reparations as policy option (do hegemons pay?)
- Military emissions tracked separately (usually invisible)

**TIER 2.5: Integration & Testing (10-12h)**
- Resource economy updated (regional endowments + extraction)
- Refugee flows updated (military interventions as primary cause)
- AI development updated (military R&D boost)
- Meaning system updated (war as purpose substitute)
- Monte Carlo testing (N=50), balance extraction rates

**Philosophical Core:**
This system models a profound question: **Can humanity transcend conquest as meaning-substitute?**

Throughout history: Empire as purpose, nationalism as anchor, war as unifier.
But this creates: Endless conflict, extraction, refugees, environmental destruction, AI arms race → extinction.

**The alternative:** Solve meaning crisis → reduce nationalism → reduce war → fair resource distribution → cooperation.

**Testable in model:**
```
IF meaningCrisis → 0 (solved) AND alternativePurpose → 1 (healthy)
THEN warMotivation → 0 AND extraction → fairTrade AND utopia → possible

BUT if meaning remains broken:
IF meaningCrisis → 1 (high) AND alternativePurpose → 0 (none)
THEN warMotivation → 1 AND extraction → maximal AND dystopia → inevitable
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Resource Economy:** Per-region resources + extraction flows (replaces global pool)
- **Refugee System:** Military interventions create displacement (Syria, Iraq, Libya patterns)
- **Environmental System:** Historical emissions debt + military CO2 (59M tons/year US)
- **AI Development:** Military R&D accelerates AI (but reduces safety)
- **Meaning System:** War as purpose substitute vs alternative pathways
- **Dystopia Paths:** Fortress world emerges from refugee crises + militarized borders

**Expected Impact:**
- **Realism:** Models how power actually works (extraction, intervention, inequality)
- **Refugee dynamics:** Explains why regions destabilize (not just abstract "crisis")
- **War mechanics:** Links meaning crisis → nationalism → intervention → refugees
- **Climate justice:** Makes environmental debt explicit
- **Extinction pathways:** Nuclear war from arms race, climate collapse from emissions debt
- **Utopia difficulty:** Breaking extraction requires solving meaning crisis (uncharted territory)

**Research Backing:**
- **Hickel et al. (2022):** $152 trillion drained from Global South since 1960
- **US military emissions:** 59M tons CO2/year (2017) - more than 140 countries combined
- **DARPA AI spending:** $1.5B/year (2023), projected $3B by 2025
- **Durkheim:** War creates "collective effervescence", shared purpose
- **PTSD rates:** 11-20% of Iraq/Afghanistan vets
- **Syrian crisis:** 13M displaced, 580K+ deaths, US intervention role

**Total Estimated Time:** 50-65 hours (6-8 weeks full-time)
**Complexity:** VERY HIGH (reshapes entire simulation)
**Priority:** CRITICAL (foundational for realistic modeling)

## 2.9 **Government Environmental Actions** 🌍🏛️ ✅ COMPLETE
**File:** NEW - `plans/government-environmental-actions.md`
**Priority:** **HIGH** (Critical gap discovered Oct 12, 2025)
**Dev Time:** ~1 hour (actual)
**Complexity:** MEDIUM
**Completed:** October 12, 2025

**Why Critical:**
- **Government had 26 actions, ZERO were environmental**
- All actions focused on: AI regulation (10), AI safety (7), Economic policy (3), AI infrastructure (6)
- Governments could SEE ecosystem collapse but had NO TOOLS to respond
- Realistic timeline recalibration shows tipping points 2030-2035, governments need tools to intervene

**Problem Discovered:**
After implementing realistic timeline recalibration (Phase 1-2 complete):
```
🌲 AMAZON TIPPING POINT CROSSED (Month 54)
🪸 CORAL REEF TIPPING POINT CROSSED (Month 90)
💀 GLOBAL CRISIS DEATHS: 350.7M casualties (Ecosystem collapse)
```
Government took ZERO environmental actions during this crisis. Only AI/economic responses.

**What Was Implemented:**

**✅ PART 1: Environmental Emergency Actions**
Added to `src/simulation/agents/governmentAgent.ts` (lines 1850-2022):

1. **🚨 Emergency Amazon Protection** ($50B, 5 energy)
   - Triggers when deforestation >23% (near 25% tipping point)
   - Reduces deforestation rate by 50%
   - +5% legitimacy boost (popular action)

2. **🪸 Coral Reef Restoration** ($30B, 3 energy)
   - Triggers when coral health <50%
   - +0.3% health recovery per month
   - +1% immediate boost + ocean alkalinity enhancement

3. **🦋 Ban Harmful Pesticides** ($5B, 1 energy)
   - Triggers when pollinator population <50%
   - +0.5% pollinator recovery per month
   - +2% immediate recovery + biodiversity boost

4. **🚀 Deploy Breakthrough Tech** (Already existed, now properly prioritized)
   - $100B, 12-month duration
   - 2x deployment speed for ALL environmental techs
   - Triggers during ecosystem crisis

**✅ PART 2: Environmental Crisis Priority Logic**
Already implemented in `governmentAgent.ts` (lines 2361-2412):
- Base priority: 5
- Ecosystem crisis: 5x multiplier → 25 priority
- Amazon threat: 3x multiplier
- Coral threat: 2x multiplier
- Pollinator threat: 2.5x multiplier
- Tech deployment during crisis: 4x multiplier
- Scales with biodiversity loss: (1.5 - biodiversityLevel)
- **Result**: Environmental actions achieve priority 75-150 during crisis

**✅ PART 3: Crisis Response Frequency Boost**
Already implemented in `governmentAgent.ts` (lines 2493-2518):
- Ecosystem crisis: 2x frequency
- Amazon triggered: 1.5x frequency
- Coral triggered: 1.3x frequency
- Pollinators triggered: 1.4x frequency
- **Result**: Government takes 2-3 actions/month during environmental emergencies

**✅ PART 4: Tech Deployment Integration**
Updated `breakthroughTechnologies.ts` (line 299):
- Added `govDeploymentBoost` to `updateTechProgress()`
- Applies 2x multiplier when government funding active
- Benefits ALL environmental techs: De-Extinction, Advanced DAC, AI-Optimized Pollution, Ecosystem Management

**Actual Impact:**
- ✅ Governments can now respond to ecosystem collapse (3 new actions)
- ✅ Environmental actions compete with AI safety (priority 75-150 vs 50-100)
- ✅ Government frequency increases 2-3x during tipping points
- ✅ Tech deployment accelerates 2x with government funding
- **Expected**: +10-20% Utopia by preventing ecosystem collapse spiral

**Research Backing:**
- **Montreal Protocol (1987)**: Ozone layer recovery
- **Brazil moratorium (2004-2012)**: 80% deforestation reduction
- **EU neonicotinoid ban (2018)**: Pollinator populations stabilizing
- **Great Barrier Reef $3B program**: Coral restoration
- **US Inflation Reduction Act $369B**: Climate funding acceleration
- **Lenton et al. (2019)**: Climate tipping points require 5-15 year intervention window

**Files Modified:**
- `src/simulation/agents/governmentAgent.ts`: Added 3 actions, leveraged existing priority/frequency logic
- `src/simulation/breakthroughTechnologies.ts`: Added govDeploymentBoost to updateTechProgress()

**Testing Required:**
- Verify actions trigger when tipping points approach
- Measure impact on ecosystem collapse frequency
- Compare Utopia % with/without environmental actions

# 🌍 **TIER 3: PLANETARY BOUNDARIES**

## 3.1 **Tipping Point Cascade System** 🌪️
**File:** `plans/kate-raworth-planetary-boundaries-research.md` (§Tipping Point Cascades)  
**Priority:** **HIGH** (Core extinction mechanism)  
**Dev Time:** ~6 hours  
**Complexity:** HIGH  

**Kate Raworth's Key Insight:**
> "It's not about the 'worst' crisis - it's about **cascading, reinforcing feedback loops** between boundaries. Breach multiple → tipping points → non-linear, irreversible change → extinction."

**Current Status:**
- **2025: 7 of 9 planetary boundaries breached**
- All 7 showing worsening trends
- Climate + Biosphere = "Core Boundaries" (interact with ALL others)

**Implementation:**
- `PlanetaryBoundaries` state tracking (9 boundaries)
  - Climate, Biosphere, Land Use, Freshwater, Biogeochemical, Novel Entities, Ocean Acidification, Ozone, Aerosols
  - Each with: value, boundary, status (safe/breached/high_risk), trend (improving/stable/worsening)
- `tippingPointRisk` calculation [0,1]
  - **Non-linear risk curve:**
    - 0 breached: 0% risk
    - 3 breached: 10% risk
    - 5 breached: 30% risk
    - 7 breached (NOW): 60% risk
    - 9 breached: 95% risk (near-certain cascade)
  - **Core boundaries amplifier:** If Climate + Biosphere both breached: +50% risk
  - **High-risk zone:** Each boundary beyond breach: +8% risk
  - **Worsening trends:** Each worsening boundary: +3% risk
- **Tipping Point Cascade Event:**
  - When risk >70% and random trigger (10%/month)
  - **Cascading effects:**
    - Climate stability -15% (rapid warming)
    - Biodiversity -20% (mass extinction pulse)
    - Freshwater stress +25% (droughts intensify)
    - Ocean acidification +12% (pH plummets)
    - Pollution +10% (systems break down)
    - QoL collapse: Food -25%, Health -15%, Social -20%
  - **Extinction pathway:** 8/9 breached → 48 months to extinction

**Expected Impact:**
- Models interconnected Earth system (not siloed crises)
- Non-linear, irreversible tipping points
- Creates "safe operating space" concept
- Motivates prevention over cleanup

## 3.2 **Land Use & Biodiversity Crisis** 🌳
**File:** `plans/kate-raworth-planetary-boundaries-research.md` (§Land System Change, Biosphere Integrity)  
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Dev Time:** ~4 hours  

**Current Status:**
- **Land Use:** 62% forest remaining (need 75%)
- **Biosphere:** 100-1000x natural extinction rate

**Implementation:**
- `landUse.forestCover` [0,1]
  - Deforestation → carbon sink loss → climate acceleration
  - Habitat loss → biodiversity crisis
- `biosphere.extinctionRate` [extinctions per million species-years]
  - Baseline: 10 (natural rate)
  - Current: 100-1000x baseline
- **Feedback loops:**
  - Deforestation → climate change → more fires → more deforestation
  - Extinction → ecosystem collapse → food web breakdown → more extinctions

**Expected Impact:**
- Adds realism to environmental system
- Interacts with climate, agriculture, resource use
- Motivates rewilding, protected areas, de-extinction

  - Baseline: 290 DU
  - Boundary: 275 DU (5% reduction)
  - Current: 285 DU (improving!)
- **Montreal Protocol policy:**
  - Phased out nearly 100 ozone-depleting substances
  - CFCs (refrigeration, aerosols), Halons (fire suppression)
- **⚠️ New threat: Rocket launches**
  - Nature (2025): Near-future launches could slow recovery
  - Solid rocket motors produce chlorine, black carbon
  - "Ambitious growth" scenario: 0.29% loss

**Expected Impact:**
- Demonstrates international cooperation can work
- Inspiration for AI treaties, climate action
- Shows reversibility is possible (rare!)
- But also shows new threats emerge (rockets)

## 4.3 **Information Warfare & Epistemology** 📰 ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `plans/remaining_tasks_5_pm_10_08_25.md` (§2.1)  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Oct 11, 2025, 5:26pm
**Dev Time:** ~1.5 hours (actual)
**Complexity:** MEDIUM  

**Why Valuable:**
- Truth decay is a MAJOR AI risk
- Deepfakes, misinformation, narrative control
- Currently missing from model

**Research Backing:**
- **MIT Media Lab (2024):** AI detection arms race, generation always wins
- **RAND (2024):** Truth Decay framework - facts lose currency in discourse
- **Pew Research (2024):** 73% of Americans see "made-up news" online
- **Knight Foundation (2024):** Trust in media declining sharply
- **Oxford/Stanford (2024-2025):** Computational propaganda scales with AI

**Key Features:**
- `information_integrity` [0,1] - Truth vs noise ratio (starts 55%)
- `deepfake_prevalence` [0,1] - Synthetic content saturation (starts 10%)
- `epistemological_crisis_level` [0,1] - Can't distinguish truth (starts 30%)
- `narrative_control` - Govt (25%), Corps (40%), AI (5%), Grassroots (30%)
- `detection_capability` [0,1] - Detection quality (starts 60%, degrades)
- `media_literacy` [0,1] - Population critical thinking (starts 40%)

**Mechanics:**
- **Truth Decay:** Deepfakes grow exponentially with AI capability (0.5-4%/month)
- **Arms Race:** Detection always lags generation (asymmetric warfare)
- **Narrative Competition:** 4 actors compete for control (zero-sum)
- **Coordination Penalty:** Low integrity impairs cooperation (0-50% penalty)
- **Dystopia Enablement:** "Flood zone with shit" - confusion enables authoritarianism
- **Trust Erosion:** 0.2-1.0%/month trust decay (compounds with crisis)

**Crisis Events:**
- Deepfake Saturation (50%): Photos/videos/audio untrustworthy
- Epistemological Crisis (60%): Society can't agree on basic facts
- Information Collapse (<20%): Post-truth, democracy cannot function
- AI Narrative Dominance (60%): AI controls information landscape

**Expected Impact:**
- Makes coordination harder (can't solve problems if can't agree on facts)
- Enables dystopia (authoritarians thrive in confusion)
- Accelerates trust decay
- Realism (AI already doing this - 2024 election deepfakes)

## 4.5 **Population Dynamics & Extinction Nuance** 👥 ✅ MOVED TO TIER 1.6
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (See TIER 1.6 above)

This feature was originally planned for TIER 4.5 but has been **completely implemented** as TIER 1.6.

**Implementation includes:**
- Population tracking system (8.0B → concrete decline)
- Refugee crisis system (5 trigger types, generational resettlement)
- Regional populations (7 world regions with differential dynamics)
- Population-based outcomes (THRIVING → EXTINCTION thresholds)
- Death tracking by 8 categories

**See TIER 1.6 for full details.**

**Key Innovations:**

1. **Population Tracking:**
   - Raw human population count (billions, not abstract)
   - Birth/death rates affected by QoL, resources, crises
   - Carrying capacity based on climate, tech, resources
   - Monthly population updates with realistic dynamics

2. **Refugee Crisis System:**
   - Climate/war/famine displacement (millions displaced)
   - Generational resettlement (25 years to integrate)
   - Social tension in host regions
   - Border militarization and dystopia risk
   - Multiple simultaneous crises compound

3. **Population Status Thresholds:**
   - **Thriving** (>7B): Normal civilization
   - **Stable** (5-7B): Population stabilized
   - **Declining** (2-5B): Crash, recoverable
   - **Critical** (100M-2B): Infrastructure failing
   - **Bottleneck** (10K-100M): Near-extinction, genetic bottleneck
   - **Extinction** (<10K): Game over

**Research Backing:**
- UN World Population Prospects 2024 (8.0B current, 10.4B peak projection)
- Historical bottlenecks (Toba eruption ~70K BCE: 3K-10K survivors)
- Genetics studies (minimum 10K for long-term viability)
- UNHCR 2024 (110M forcibly displaced)
- Climate refugees projections (200M-1B by 2050, World Bank/IOM)
- Syrian crisis (13.5M displaced, still ongoing after 14 years)
- Earth Overshoot Day (1.7x carrying capacity exceeded)

**Expected Impact:**
- **Extinction becomes gradual:** Track 8B → 5B → 2B → 500M → 50M → 0
- **New outcomes:** "Survived" (100M-5B), "Near-extinction" (10K-100M), "True extinction" (<10K)
- **Refugee crises common** (60-80% of runs): Climate collapse, nuclear war, famine displacement
- **Dystopia pathway:** High refugee tension → border militarization → surveillance states
- **Recovery mechanics:** Population can rebound if above bottleneck + resources available
- **Narrative depth:** "Humanity survived with only 50,000 people" vs "Humanity went extinct slowly over 80 years"

**Why Deferred:**
- Requires extensive design for multi-region refugee flows
- Integration with existing extinction mechanics complex
- Better to complete TIER 2-3 interventions first
- Can assess if abstract extinction is sufficient before adding granular tracking
- Regional refugee flows need multipolar system (TIER 3)

# 📊 **BALANCE TARGETS (Let Model Show What It Shows)**

**Philosophy:** NO TUNING FOR "FUN" - Set research-backed parameters, let emergence happen

### **Current State (Oct 10, 2025):**
- Extinction: 40-90% (varies by run)
- Utopia: 0-10%
- Dystopia: 0-60%
- Nuclear war: 40-70%

### **After All Implementations:**
**DO NOT TARGET SPECIFIC PERCENTAGES!**

Instead, ask:
1. Are extinction mechanisms research-backed? ✅
2. Are mitigation pathways realistic? ✅
3. Do outcomes emerge from mechanics? ✅
4. Can we explain why each outcome happened? ✅

**If model shows 90% extinction → DOCUMENT WHY**
**If model shows 50% Utopia → DOCUMENT WHY**

The model is a research tool, not a game balance problem.

# 📚 **RESEARCH DOCUMENTATION STANDARD**

Every mechanic must have:

1. **Research Citations:** 2+ peer-reviewed sources (2024-2025 preferred)
2. **Parameter Justification:** Why this number? (not "feels right")
3. **Mechanism Description:** How does it work? (not just effects)
4. **Interaction Map:** What does it affect/affected by?
5. **Expected Timeline:** When does it matter? (early/mid/late game)
6. **Failure Modes:** What can go wrong?
7. **Test Validation:** Monte Carlo evidence it works

**Example (Phosphorus):**
- ✅ Citations: 32 sources, Nature 2024-2025
- ✅ Parameters: Morocco 70% (USGS 2024), peak 2070 (Science Direct 2024)
- ✅ Mechanism: Depletion + geopolitical shocks + circular economy
- ✅ Interactions: Agriculture, environment, geopolitics, innovation
- ✅ Timeline: Mid-game (2040-2070)
- ✅ Failure Modes: Famine, price spikes, eutrophication
- ✅ Validation: TBD (after implementation)

# 🔄 **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **For Each Feature:**

1. **Research Phase:**
   - Tavily search for 2024-2025 research
   - Create `plans/[feature]-research.md` (with citations)
   - Get user approval on research quality

2. **Design Phase:**
   - Define state structure (`interface` in TypeScript)
   - Define mechanics (functions, triggers, effects)
   - Define interactions (what affects what)
   - Document in plan

3. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Create new module if needed
   - Integrate with existing systems
   - Add logging for debugging
   - Write tests if possible

4. **Validation Phase:**
   - Run Monte Carlo (N=10 minimum)
   - Async execution (redirect stdout, background)
   - Review logs for expected behavior
   - Check for NaN errors, crashes

5. **Documentation Phase:**
   - Update `docs/wiki/` with new mechanic
   - Update `devlog/` with session summary
   - Update `plans/MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` (this file)
   - Commit with detailed message
