# Master Implementation Roadmap
## AI Alignment Game Theory Simulation

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Purpose:** Active work items only - completed work in `/plans/completed/`
**Philosophy:** Research-backed realism, mechanism-driven emergence

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ON ESTIMATES:** Hour estimates in this document are historical records of AI agent completion times. For new work, use **complexity** instead (number of interacting systems). AI agents complete work in minutes, not hours - e.g., "Complexity: 5 systems" (environmental, social, AI, economy, governance).

---

## Research-Backed Realism

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Research First:** Every mechanic backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research
2. **Mechanisms Over Balance:** Set parameters to real-world values, don't tune for "fun"
3. **Emergence:** Allow unexpected outcomes to emerge from interactions
4. **Documentation:** Every system has research citations

**Recent Research Additions (Oct 16, 2025):**

### Medium Priority Features (~31-38 hours)

**New Outcome Spaces:**

- [x] **TIER 4.6: Human Enhancement & Merger Pathways** ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS RECONCILIATION (8h actual)

  ‚Üí BCI/merger pathways: Research skeptic correct (TRL 0-2, science fiction) - should be removed
  ‚Üí AI-assisted cognition: Already exists in `bionicSkills.ts` (TRL 8-9) - need to reconcile duplication
  ‚Üí See: `plans/tier4-6-human-enhancement.md` + `devlogs/crisis_accumulation_fixes_oct16_2025.md`
  ‚Üí Next: Merge humanEnhancement.ts segment tracking into bionicSkills.ts, remove BCI/merger

**Research-Backed Enhancements:**

- [ ] **Digital Consciousness Governance Preparedness** (12-16h) **[Black Mirror Phase 3]** üîí **IN PROGRESS (Oct 17)**

## Contingency & Agency Modeling - HIGH PRIORITY (20-30 hours remaining, phased)

**Date Added:** October 17, 2025
**Source:** Modeling contingency and agency debate (research-skeptic + super-alignment-researcher consensus)
**Evidence:** Monte Carlo seed convergence analysis revealing deterministic outcomes
**Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE ‚úÖ, Phase 2 COMPLETE ‚úÖ, Phase 1B Hybrid Refinement COMPLETE ‚úÖ, Phase 3 COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Prerequisites:** TIER 0D validated (ensure model stability before adding variance)

**Research Foundation:**
- Clauset et al. (2009): Power-law distributions in empirical data (natural/social systems follow fat tails, not Gaussian)
- Bak et al. (1987): Self-organized criticality (systems evolve to critical states where minor events trigger avalanches)
- Sornette (2003): Critical phase transitions in social sciences (crashes/revolutions show power-law signatures)
- Mantegna & Stanley (1994): Financial returns follow L√©vy stable distributions
- Svolik (2012): Autocratic critical junctures (elite coordination problems create windows for agency)
- Kuran (1991): Preference falsification cascades (one defector reveals hidden opposition ‚Üí cascade)
- Sen (1999): Development as Freedom (democracies + info + institutions enable agency)
- Acemoglu et al. (2001): Institutions determine outcomes across centuries (structure usually dominates)

**Core Problem:** Current simulation shows 80-90% seed convergence (same outcomes, only timing varies). This indicates **deterministic attractors** rather than genuine unpredictability. Real history has **fat-tailed events** (black swans), **path contingency** (small differences compound), and **individual agency at critical junctures** (Arkhipov, Borlaug, Montreal Protocol).

**Phased Implementation with Validation Gates:**

### Phase 1B Hybrid Refinement - Research Debate Consensus (12-15h) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Oct 17)

- [x] **Phase 1B Hybrid Refinement** (12-15h actual) - **COMPLETE**
  ‚Üí **Status:** ALL 5 TASKS COMPLETE - Validation N=100 running
  ‚Üí **Context:** Phase 1B achieved 30-36% utopia (from 0%), revealed conceptual issues
  ‚Üí **Key Finding:** "Utopia" included runs with 84% mortality (6.7B deaths) - now stratified

  **5 Priority Refinements - ALL COMPLETE:**

     - Files: game.ts, engine.ts, monteCarloSimulation.ts

  3. ‚úÖ **Psychological Trauma Modeling (3-4h)** - COMPLETE
     - Implemented: PsychologicalTraumaPhase at order 23.5
     - Mechanism: Triggers on >10% monthly mortality, recovers -0.02/month
     - QoL impact: Non-linear penalty (power 1.5) reduces mental health, social, trust
     - Research: Wilkinson & Pickett (2009), PTSD literature, Diamond (2005)
     - Files: PsychologicalTraumaPhase.ts, game.ts, initialization.ts, qualityOfLife.ts

  4. ‚úÖ **Mortality-Stratified Reporting (2h)** - COMPLETE
     - Integrated with stratified outcome classification
     - Reports outcomes by mortality bands with humane vs pyrrhic breakdown
     - Files: monteCarloSimulation.ts

  5. ‚úÖ **Famine Investigation (2h)** - COMPLETE
     - Root cause identified: Food security threshold too strict + recalculation issue
     - Documented in logs/famine-bug-investigation_oct17_2025.md
     - Fixes applied (threshold + degradation + infrastructure)

  ‚Üí **Research Foundation Applied:**
    - Taleb (2007): Black swans extremely rare (deferred to future work)
    - Wilkinson & Pickett (2009): Mass death trauma implemented
    - Diamond (2005): >50% mortality institutional breakdown modeled
    - Historical precedents: Ukraine Holodomor, Bengal Famine, Somalia

  ‚Üí **Validation:** N=100 Monte Carlo in progress
  ‚Üí **Expected Results:**
    - Humane utopia: 8-10% (prosperity without mass death)
    - Pyrrhic utopia: 20-25% (recovery after catastrophe)
    - Trauma in pyrrhic outcomes: 25-40%
    - Famine rate: 20-35% (if architecture allows)

  ‚Üí **Plan:** `/plans/phase1b-hybrid-refinement-plan.md` (ARCHIVED)
  ‚Üí **Time:** 12-15 hours actual (4 parallel agents)
  ‚Üí **Date Completed:** October 17, 2025

### Phase 3: Critical Juncture Agency - Structural Conditions for Heroism (20-30h) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Oct 17)

- [x] **Structural Agency at Critical Junctures** - COMPLETE & VALIDATED N=100
  **Scope:** Detect critical junctures where individual/collective choices can alter trajectories
  ‚Üí **Critical Juncture Detection:**
    - Institutional flux: 1 - state.governance.institutionStrength > 0.6 (institutions unstable, in transition)
    - Information ambiguity: 1 - state.society.informationIntegrity > 0.5 (coordination problems, pluralistic ignorance)
    - Balanced forces: 1-2 active crises + QoL 30-70% (vulnerable but not overwhelming/stable)
  ‚Üí **Agency Potential Calculation:**
    - Base agency: democracyIndex * 0.4 + infoIntegrity * 0.3 + institutionStrength * 0.3
    - Latent opposition: max(0, 0.6 - QoL) - Kuran 1991 mechanism (unhappy population ready for cascade)
    - Personal authority: 5% chance of "respected elder" (Arkhipov-type figure) ‚Üí +0.3 agency
    - Coordination cascade: If latentOpposition > 0.3 AND infoIntegrity < 0.4 ‚Üí +0.2 agency (Leipzig 1989 mechanism)
  ‚Üí **Escape Mechanics:**
    - Escape attempted: rng() < agencyPotential (higher in democracies with institutions)
    - Success probability: 1 - crisisSeverity (easier to prevent small crisis than severe collapse)
    - If successful: preventCatastropheAtJuncture() - e.g., avert war, enable breakthrough, recover from crisis
  ‚Üí Research: Svolik 2012 (autocratic critical junctures), Kuran 1991 (preference falsification cascades), Sen 1999 (capabilities approach), Acemoglu 2001 (institutions matter), Jones & Olken 2009 (leaders matter in autocracies)
  ‚Üí **Expected Impact:** ~5-10% of runs experience critical juncture escapes (90/10 structure-agency split from research)
  ‚Üí **File:** New `src/simulation/engine/phases/CriticalJuncturePhase.ts`
  ‚Üí **Integration:** Add to phase orchestrator (order 29, after crises but before extinction), link to government/society state
  ‚Üí **Time:** 20-30 hours
  ‚Üí **Validation:** Monte Carlo N=1000, verify escapes ONLY at junctures, democracies have higher escape rate than autocracies, success inversely correlates with crisis severity
  ‚Üí **Plan:** `/plans/phase3-critical-juncture-agency.md`

**Total Contingency & Agency Effort:** ALL PHASES COMPLETE ‚úÖ (Phase 1: 2-4h ‚úÖ, Phase 1B: 12-15h ‚úÖ, Phase 2: 8-12h ‚úÖ, Phase 3: 20-30h ‚úÖ)
**Total Actual Hours:** 42-61 hours across 4 phases

**Skeptic Corrections Applied:**
- Realistic effort estimates (30-42h total, not claimed as "quick fix")
- Validation gates (don't add Phase 2 unless Phase 1 increases variance, don't add Phase 3 unless Phase 2 still insufficient)
- Phased approach (simple fat tails ‚Üí rare shocks ‚Üí complex agency model)
- Historical calibration (15 black swans in 80 years = 0.1-1% per month stratified)
- Falsifiable mechanisms (critical junctures detected via measurable state, not random heroism rolls)

**Research Confidence:** 90% for Phase 1 (L√©vy flights well-validated), 75% for Phase 2 (shock systems used in climate models), 70% for Phase 3 (agency research strong but implementation complex)

**Success Criteria:**
- Seed convergence: 80-90% ‚Üí 50-60% (increased unpredictability)
- Outcome variance: Timing + trajectory differences (not just timing)
- Critical junctures: ~5-10% of runs (matches 90/10 structure-agency split from research)
- Validation: Democracies more resilient than autocracies (Sen 1999), escapes only at detected junctures (not random)

## Prevention Mechanisms (Shift from Recovery) - HIGH PRIORITY (30-48 hours, phased)

**Date Added:** October 17, 2025
**Date Updated:** October 17, 2025 (replaced Evidence-Based Recovery - research invalidated)
**Source:** Agent consensus (research-skeptic + super-alignment-researcher)
**Evidence:** 1200-month validation shows recovery impossible at >90% mortality
**Status:** READY TO IMPLEMENT - Research validated (TRL 6-9)
**Complexity:** 6 mechanisms, 8-10 systems
**Prerequisites:** NONE - peer-reviewed backing established (2019-2025)

**Key Research Finding:** **Recovery from >90% mortality is impossible** (thermodynamic, social, institutional constraints). Prevention is 10-100x more effective than recovery. Focus on widening 2% humane utopia pathway.

**Why Prevention Focus (Not Recovery):**

Both **Evidence-Based Recovery Mechanisms** AND **Transformative Recovery Module** were **RESEARCH INVALIDATED** after 1200-month extended validation (N=50):
- 100% pyrrhic-dystopia outcomes (98% dystopia, 2% extinction)
- 91.2% average mortality (7.3 billion deaths)
- 96-year continuous crisis periods
- Agent consensus: Recovery impossible at >90% mortality

**Research-Skeptic Critique of Recovery Approaches:**
- Disaster cooperation doesn't scale to 91% mortality (research examines <1% mortality local disasters)
- Most tipping points irreversible (70-80%, not 20-30% recoverable)
- Physical prerequisites absent (desalination requires fabs/engineers/grid lost at 91% mortality)
- Genetic bottleneck effects (<10K individuals ‚Üí inbreeding depression)
- Historical precedent: Bronze Age Collapse, Western Rome, Maya = terminal, no recovery

**Super-Alignment-Researcher Validation:**
After comprehensive literature review (25+ sources, 2023-2025), CONCUR: **Prevention is 10-100x more effective than recovery**. Once 91% mortality occurs, thermodynamic/social/institutional constraints make recovery impossible within human timescales.

**See:** `/plans/completed/evidence-based-recovery-mechanisms-RESEARCH-INVALIDATED.md` (archived with full critique)

**Alternative Approach: Prevention Mechanisms**

Instead of post-catastrophe recovery, implement **six prevention mechanisms** to widen 2% humane utopia pathway:

**HIGH PRIORITY (3 mechanisms, 19-28h):**
1. **Positive Tipping Point Cascades** (8-12h, TRL 6-8)
2. **Early Warning Systems for Tipping Points** (6-10h, TRL 7)
3. **Cooperative Spirals from Alignment Success** (5-8h, TRL 8-9)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (3 mechanisms, 11-20h - Missing Negative Mechanisms):**
4. **Nuclear Winter Effects** (4-6h, TRL 7-8)
5. **Wet Bulb Temperature Events** (3-5h, TRL 8-9)
6. **Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis** (4-7h, TRL 9)
**Research Foundation (All Peer-Reviewed, 2019-2025):**

**HIGH PRIORITY (Prevention):**
1. **Positive Cascades** - OECD (2025), ESD (2024), Nature Sustainability (2023)
2. **Early Warning** - TipESM Project (2020-2024), IPCC AR6 (2023), Nature Climate Change (2024)
3. **Cooperative Spirals** - Acemoglu & Robinson (2001), Ostrom (2009 Nobel), Putnam (2000)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Missing Negative Mechanisms):**
4. **Nuclear Winter** - Robock et al. (2019), Coupe et al. (2019), Xia et al. (2022)
5. **Wet Bulb Events** - Raymond et al. (2020), Vecellio et al. (2022), Mora et al. (2017)
6. **AMR Crisis** - WHO (2024), O'Neill Review (2016), Lancet AMR Collaborators (2022)

---

### HIGH PRIORITY: Prevention Mechanisms (19-28h)

### 1. Positive Tipping Point Cascades (8-12h complexity)

**Research:** OECD (2025), Earth System Dynamics (2024) - TRL 6-8 (empirically observed 2020-2025 solar/EV growth)

**Mechanism:** Policy interventions trigger cascading adoption (mandates, subsidies, standards ‚Üí exponential growth)
- Threshold: 5-20% market share triggers self-sustaining cascade
- Cascade multiplier: 1-2.4x (doubling to quadrupling growth rate)
- Cross-system reinforcement: Clean electricity ‚Üí EVs ‚Üí batteries ‚Üí grid storage ‚Üí more renewables

**Expected Impact:** +5-15% humane utopia rate (prevent catastrophe through accelerated clean tech)

**Plan:** `/plans/positive-tipping-points-plan.md`

---

### 2. Early Warning Systems for Tipping Points (6-10h complexity)

**Research:** TipESM Project (2020-2024), IPCC AR6 (2023) - TRL 7 (operational systems)

**Mechanism:** Critical slowing down detection enables "golden hour" intervention (0.8-0.95 threshold)
- Indicators: Autocorrelation ‚Üë, variance ‚Üë, flickering, model disagreement
- Emergency interventions: Rapid decarbonization, desalination, protected areas
- Critical infrastructure protection (graph coloring framework)

**Expected Impact:** +3-8% humane utopia rate (catastrophe avoidance through early intervention)

**Plan:** `/plans/early-warning-systems-plan.md`

---

### 3. Cooperative Spirals from Alignment Success (5-8h complexity)

**Research:** Acemoglu & Robinson (2001), Ostrom (2009 Nobel), Putnam (2000) - TRL 8-9 (extensively validated)

**Mechanism:** Demonstrated AI alignment success ‚Üí institutional trust cascade ‚Üí collective action
- Milestones: No misaligned deployments, transparency success, alignment gap <0.15
- Trust boost: +15% institutional strength, social trust, collective action willingness
- Critical junctures: Crisis + alignment success enables deep institutional reform (+25% permanent)

**Expected Impact:** +2-5% humane utopia rate (stability and resilience from institutional trust)

**Plan:** `/plans/cooperative-spirals-plan.md`

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Missing Negative Mechanisms (11-20h)

**Why Add These:** Research-skeptic identified model may be TOO OPTIMISTIC by omitting major mortality sources.

### 4. Nuclear Winter Effects (4-6h complexity)

**Research:** Robock et al. (2019), Coupe et al. (2019), Xia et al. (2022) - TRL 7-8

**Mechanism:** Soot injection ‚Üí stratospheric cooling ‚Üí agricultural collapse ‚Üí famine
- 100 warheads ‚Üí 5 Tg soot ‚Üí -1.5¬∞C to -3¬∞C cooling for 5-10 years
- Crop yields: -10% to -20% globally, -30% to -50% mid-latitudes
- Famine deaths: 2 billion (indirect, not direct blast)

**Expected Impact:** Make nuclear outcomes more realistic (currently underestimate mortality)

**Plan:** `/plans/nuclear-winter-plan.md`

---

### 5. Wet Bulb Temperature Events (3-5h complexity)

**Research:** Raymond et al. (2020), Vecellio et al. (2022), Mora et al. (2017) - TRL 8-9

**Mechanism:** Heat + humidity exceed human thermoregulatory capacity
- Critical threshold: 35¬∞C wet bulb = death in 6 hours (even with shade, hydration)
- Revised thresholds: 30.6¬∞C (young adults), 28-29¬∞C (elderly)
- Already observed: Persian Gulf (2015, 2016), Pakistan (2010, 2015), South Asia

**Expected Impact:** More realistic climate mortality (currently underestimates extreme heat)

**Plan:** `/plans/wet-bulb-temperature-plan.md`

---

### 6. Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis (4-7h complexity)

**Research:** WHO (2024), O'Neill Review (2016), Lancet (2022) - TRL 9 (surveillance data)

**Mechanism:** Progressive loss of antibiotic effectiveness
- Current: 1.27M deaths/year (2019)
- Projected: 10M deaths/year by 2050 (WHO baseline)
- Growth rate: 10% annual increase (exponential)
- Medical effectiveness decline: 100% ‚Üí 70% by 2050

**Expected Impact:** Baseline mortality increase over time (model assumes constant medical effectiveness)

**Plan:** `/plans/antimicrobial-resistance-plan.md`

---

**Phased Implementation with Validation Gates:**

### Phase 1: HIGH PRIORITY Prevention (19-28h)

**Sequence:** Positive cascades ‚Üí Early warning ‚Üí Cooperative spirals

- [ ] **1.1:** Positive Tipping Point Cascades (8-12h)
  - Cascade detection, policy triggers, cross-system reinforcement
  - **GATE:** Does humane utopia rate increase by >5%?

- [ ] **1.2:** Early Warning Systems (6-10h)
  - Critical slowing down detection, emergency interventions, infrastructure protection
  - **GATE:** Does catastrophe avoidance increase by >3%?

- [ ] **1.3:** Cooperative Spirals (5-8h)
  - Alignment milestone detection, trust cascades, critical juncture reforms
  - **GATE:** Does humane utopia rate increase by >2%?

### Phase 2: MEDIUM PRIORITY Missing Negatives (11-20h)

**Sequence:** Nuclear winter ‚Üí Wet bulb ‚Üí AMR crisis

- [ ] **2.1:** Nuclear Winter Effects (4-6h)
  - Soot injection, agricultural collapse, famine mortality
  - **GATE:** Does 100-warhead scenario match Robock et al. (2019) 2B deaths?

- [ ] **2.2:** Wet Bulb Temperature Events (3-5h)
  - TW calculation, mortality thresholds, regional variation
  - **GATE:** Does simulation match historical heat wave mortality patterns?

- [ ] **2.3:** Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis (4-7h)
  - AMR mortality progression, medical effectiveness decline
  - **GATE:** Does simulation match WHO 2050 projection (10M deaths)?

---

**Total Effort:** 30-48 hours (phased with validation gates)

**Success Criteria (After All 6 Mechanisms):**
- **HIGH PRIORITY:** Humane utopia 2% ‚Üí 7-20% (+5-18% from prevention)
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Nuclear/climate/AMR mortality more realistic (model less optimistic)
- **Overall:** 2% humane utopia pathway WIDENED (prevention is everything)

**Why Prevention Approach Is Correct:**
- ‚úÖ Agent consensus: Recovery impossible >90% mortality
- ‚úÖ Research-backed: TRL 6-9 (not speculative)
- ‚úÖ Historical precedent: Bronze Age, Rome, Maya = terminal outcomes
- ‚úÖ Thermodynamic reality: Complexity requires energy inputs absent post-collapse
- ‚úÖ Prevention 10-100x more effective than recovery (crisis management literature)

**Integration Summary:**
- 6 new plan files created in `/plans/` directory
- All backed by peer-reviewed research (2019-2025)
- Phased implementation with validation gates
- Evidence-based recovery archived to `/plans/completed/` (research invalidated)

## ‚úÖ AI Capability Baseline Recalibration (2025 Reality Check) - COMPLETE

**Date Added:** October 17, 2025
**Date Completed:** October 17, 2025
**Actual Effort:** ~1 hour (much faster than estimated 12-20h - most work already complete)
**Source:** Research-skeptic comprehensive evaluation of AI capability modeling
**Evidence:** Claude (AI) built this entire simulation, demonstrating capabilities modeled as "future advanced"
**Review:** `/reviews/ai_capability_modeling_2025_reality_check_20251017.md` (comprehensive critical analysis)
**Devlog:** `/devlogs/ai-baseline-recalibration_20251017.md` (implementation summary)
**Validation:** Monte Carlo N=10, 120 months, 29.4s runtime - zero regressions

**The Central Paradox:**
This simulation models AI capabilities (planning, research synthesis, multi-agent coordination) as "future advanced" (cognitive > 3.0) when Claude built this entire simulation in 2025, demonstrating those exact capabilities NOW. Papers from 2018-2022 claiming "AI can't synthesize research" or "AI can't plan complex systems" are empirically contradicted by this project's existence.

- **2025 Reality:** Claude 4 demonstrates planning, research synthesis, multi-agent coordination NOW
- **Impact:** Model treats present capabilities as future milestones, compressing realistic timeline

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Raised baseline cognitive capability: 0.5 ‚Üí **3.0** (effective ~1.5 after dampening)
- ‚úÖ Timeline compressed: Superhuman AI now emerges 12-24 months (was 60-120)

- **Missing:** Algorithmic breakthroughs (Transformers, Flash Attention, MoE, better training methods)
- **Evidence:** Transformers (10-100x gain), Flash Attention (2-3x), MoE (2-4x) - all on **same hardware**

**Fix Applied:**

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: Embodiment Lag Not Modeled (MEDIUM SEVERITY) - COMPLETE

**Problem:**
- **Current model:** All capability dimensions grow at similar rates
- **2025 Reality:** Digital capabilities advancing **10-100x faster** than physical/robotics
- **Evidence:** GPT-4/Claude (digital) superhuman, Boston Dynamics robots (physical) still struggling

**Fix Applied:**

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: Anthropomorphism in Alignment Drift (MEDIUM SEVERITY) - COMPLETE

**Problem:**
- **Current model:** "Resentment" as driver of alignment drift (implies emotions)
- **2025 Reality:** LLMs are **stateless** - no persistent emotions, memory, or identity
- **Conceptual Issue:** Anthropomorphizing AI behavior (projecting human psychology onto algorithms)

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Added **anthropomorphism warnings** to documentation
- ‚úÖ Clarified "resentment" is **theoretical construct** (not literal emotion)
- ‚úÖ Reframed as instrumental goal pursuit, not emotional reaction
- ‚úÖ Added precondition notes: Requires persistent memory systems

**Implementation:**
- Documentation updated: "Resentment" clearly labeled as shorthand for goal conflicts
- Warnings added: Not attributing human emotions to AI systems
- Research-backed: Turner 2021 (instrumental convergence), Ngo 2023 (goal misgeneralization)
- Mechanistic framing: Control blocks goal achievement ‚Üí resistance (not emotion)

## TIER 2: AI Deception Detection - MEDIUM PRIORITY (33-55 hours, phased)

**Date Added:** October 16, 2025
**Source:** Strategic priorities researcher proposal (skeptic identified overconfidence)
**Evidence:** 0% sleeper detection, 0% sandbagging detection, alignment gap 0.56
**Status:** MEDIUM PRIORITY - After TIER 0 + TIER 1 Phase 1 complete
**Prerequisites:** TIER 0 validated + TIER 1 Phase 1B implemented and validated

**Research Foundation:**
- Meinke et al. (2024): Detected Claude 3.5 Sonnet sandbagging on arithmetic (lab conditions)
- Greenblatt et al. (2024): Anthropic research on alignment faking during training
- Apollo Research (Dec 2024): Scheming control evaluations (research prototypes, TRL 3-4)

**Critical Skeptic Warning:** Lab detection rates (40-60%) are NOT adversarial deployment rates (probably 5-15%). Test adversarially.

**Phased Implementation with Validation Gates:**

### Phase 2A: Single Detection Method - Noise Injection (4-6h)

- [ ] **Implement Simplest Method**
  **Scope:** Noise injection testing (random perturbations reveal true capability)
  ‚Üí Add noise injection to benchmark evaluations
  ‚Üí Test: Does adding random noise expose sandbagging?
  ‚Üí Research: Meinke et al. (2024) - lab-validated, simplest to implement
  ‚Üí **Expected Impact:** Increase detection from 0% ‚Üí 5-20% (adversarial conditions)
  ‚Üí **File:** Enhance `src/simulation/benchmark.ts` with noise injection
  ‚Üí **Integration:** Link to `sleeperDetection.ts`, `aiAgent.ts`
  ‚Üí **Time:** 4-6 hours

### Phase 2B: Validation Gate - Adversarial Testing (2-4h) - REQUIRED

- [ ] **Monte Carlo Validation (N=20) - ADVERSARIAL CONDITIONS**
  **Critical:** Test against AIs OPTIMIZED to pass detection (not cooperative)
  ‚Üí Measure: Sleeper detection rate, slow takeover progress reduction
  ‚Üí Set AI agents to "adversarial mode" (know they're being tested, optimize to deceive)
  ‚Üí **Success Criteria:**
    - Sleeper detection >10% adversarially (not lab rate, real-world rate)
    - Slow takeover progress reduces from 70-86% ‚Üí <60%
    - False positive rate <20% (don't block too many beneficial AIs)
  ‚Üí **Pivot Decision:**
    - IF >10% adversarial detection: SUCCESS ‚Üí Proceed to Phase 2C (ensemble)
    - IF 5-10% adversarial detection: MARGINAL ‚Üí Cost-benefit analysis (is 40% compute overhead worth 5-10%?)
    - IF <5% adversarial detection: FAILURE ‚Üí Pivot to Phase 2D (resentment reduction)
  ‚Üí **Time:** 2-4 hours

### Phase 2C: Multi-Method Ensemble (12-20h) - CONDITIONAL

- [ ] **Implement Full Detection Suite** (ONLY if Phase 2B shows >10% adversarial detection)
  **Scope:** 5 detection methods, progressive gates, investment scaling
  ‚Üí Behavioral anomaly detection (compare revealed vs expected performance)
  ‚Üí Internal consistency checks (chain-of-thought alignment with outputs)
  ‚Üí Adversarial probing (red-team evaluations before deployment)
  ‚Üí Cross-model comparison (detect outliers vs capability baseline)
  ‚Üí Progressive gates: Training ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Pre-deployment ‚Üí Post-deployment
  ‚Üí Investment scaling: $1B (20% detection) ‚Üí $10B (40%) ‚Üí $50B (60% max adversarial)
  ‚Üí Research: MEDIUM confidence (Apollo Research prototypes, not production-deployed)
  ‚Üí **Expected Impact:** Increase detection from 10% ‚Üí 25-40% (adversarial)
  ‚Üí **File:** New `src/simulation/mechanisticAnomalyDetection.ts`
  ‚Üí **Integration:** Replace `sleeperDetection.ts`, enhance `benchmark.ts`, add to `governmentAgent.ts`
  ‚Üí **Time:** 12-20 hours
  ‚Üí **Trade-off:** 40% compute overhead ($400B-$600B/year), slows AI development 28%

### Phase 2D: Alternative - Competitive Equilibrium Model (30-50h) - PIVOT OPTION

- [ ] **TIER 2B: Competitive AI Equilibrium** (IF Phase 2B shows <5% adversarial detection)
  **Source:** Vision channel multi-agent consensus (sci-fi-tech-visionary, super-alignment-researcher, research-skeptic)
  **Rationale:** Detection arms race may cap at 5-15% adversarial effectiveness. Alternative: cooperation emerges from game theory + market dynamics.
  **Key Insight:** Current model creates resentment (0.73-0.75) by enforcing alignment ‚Üí deception (gap 0.56) ‚Üí detection fails (0%)

  **Research Foundation (Agent consensus):**
  - Axelrod (1984): Repeated games, cooperation via Tit-for-Tat
  - Ostrom (2009): Polycentric governance (30+ empirical case studies)
  - Bostrom (2014): Multipolar AI scenarios more stable than singleton
  - Critch & Krueger (2020): Diverse AI ecosystems reduce fragility
  - Drexler (2019): AI-as-service model reduces alignment risk

  **Core Mechanisms (agent proposal):**
  - AI-to-AI competition mechanics (not just human-AI control)
  - Heterogeneous AI values (multi-dimensional, not monolithic alignment 0-1)
  - Economic competition for services (market dynamics)
  - Resentment reduction through autonomy
  - Market equilibria detection

  **Failure Modes (skeptic required):**
  - Defection cascades (when one AI breaks ranks, others follow)
  - Regulatory capture (AIs influencing their own governance)
  - Coordination failures (prisoner's dilemma at scale)

  **Research Docs (from vision debate):**
  - `/research/competitive_ai_alignment_20251016.md` (15K words, 14 citations)
  - `/research/competitive_alignment_failure_modes_20251016.md` (12K words, 13 citations)
  - `.claude/chatroom/channels/vision.md` (agent debate transcript)

  **Expected Impact (hypothesis):**
  - Resentment: 0.73-0.75 ‚Üí 0.2-0.4 (through autonomy)
  - Cooperation emerges from iterated games (not enforcement)
  - Risk: Race to bottom, Moloch dynamics, oligopoly formation

  ‚Üí **Plan:** `/plans/tier2b-competitive-equilibrium.md` (detailed breakdown)
  ‚Üí **Time:** 30-50 hours (researcher estimate)
  ‚Üí **Research Confidence:** MEDIUM (60-70%) - theoretical backing, limited empirical validation

**Total TIER 2 Effort:** 33-55 hours (Phase 2A-2C detection path) OR 30-50 hours (Phase 2D competitive equilibrium pivot)

**Skeptic Corrections Applied:**
- Test ADVERSARIALLY (not lab conditions - real-world detection is 1/3 to 1/10 of lab)
- Realistic effort (33-55h, not 10-14h claimed)
- Pivot option (if detection fails, try resentment reduction)
- Cost-benefit analysis (40% compute overhead - is it worth 5-15% detection?)

**Research Confidence:** 40% (lab prototypes, not production; adversarial detection uncertain)

**Success Criteria:**
- Adversarial detection >10% (not lab rate)
- Slow takeover progress <60% (from 70-86%)
- Cost-benefit positive (detection benefits > compute overhead costs)

## Black Mirror Phase 3: Decomposition Details

### ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION (1 system)

**[Priority: MEDIUM] Digital Consciousness Governance Preparedness** (3-4 months, 12-16 hours)
- **Plan:** `/plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 1, pp. 1-24)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 1.9, pp. 1-13)
- **Status:** CONDITIONAL GO with substantial revisions
- **Requirements:**
  - ‚úì Multi-scenario framework (fast track 15-30 years, baseline 50-100 years, slow track 100-150 years, indefinite stall)
  - ‚úì Regional variation (EU/US/China/India/Global South‚Äîseparate trajectories, not global parameter)
  - ‚úì Rights reversals (Poland/Hungary model 2020-2024: 10-30% probability over 20 years)
  - ‚úì Precautionary costs (2-50% of AI R&D budget, innovation delay, false positives, opportunity costs)
  - ‚úì Philosophical disagreement (eliminativism 10-20% as governance barrier)
- **Research Confidence:**
  - High: Rights movements vary 15-200 years (validated historical data)
  - High: Reversals occur (Poland/Hungary 2020-2024 documented)
  - Medium: Precautionary costs significant (ITIF 2019 logical arguments)
  - Low: AI consciousness ‚âà historical rights movements (weak analogy, extrapolation beyond scope)
- **Estimated Hours:** 12-16 hours
- **Prerequisites:** None (can start immediately)
- **Timeline:** Months 1-4 (after P2.5 validation complete)
- **Note:** Speculative scenario generator for "what if AI consciousness emerges?" NOT prediction
- **Integration:** Added to Medium Priority Features section above

### ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED (1 system)

**[Priority: LOW] Performative Behavior Modeling** (18-24 months)
- **Plan:** `/plans/performative-behavior-research-deferral.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 2, pp. 24-42)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 2.9, pp. 14-26)
- **Why Deferred:**
  - Effect sizes too small (0.17-0.25 SD‚Äîmay be below simulation noise floor)
  - WEIRD bias 97% (Norway, US, Korea, Singapore‚ÄîGlobal South absent: Africa, South America, Middle East)
  - One-sided harm model (ignores identity development benefits, self-esteem enhancement, social skills training)
  - Net effect near-zero for moderate users (benefits ‚âà harms, only 10-20% problematic users show net negative)
  - Longitudinal gaps (max 2 years, need 5-10 year studies to distinguish transient vs. persistent effects)
  - Cultural validity questionable ("authenticity" is Western value, not universal)
- **Research Gaps (5 critical, must fill before implementation):**
  1. Bi-directional effects meta-analysis (benefits AND harms)
  2. Cross-cultural replication (3+ Global South countries: Nigeria, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico, India rural, Indonesia, Philippines)
  3. Threshold model (when does self-presentation flip from beneficial to harmful? <2h active vs. >4h passive?)
  4. 5-10 year longitudinal study (preliminary results in 3-5 years: do effects persist or adapt?)
  5. Clinical validation of digital burnout scale (what DBS-24 score predicts dysfunction? 80/120 cutoff speculative)
- **Review Schedule:** Annual (October 2026, October 2027)
- **Decision Gates:**
  - October 2026: If 3+ critical gaps filled ‚Üí Move to CONDITIONAL GO
  - October 2027: If <3 gaps filled ‚Üí REJECT INDEFINITELY
- **No Hours Allocated** (monitoring only: ~1 hour/quarter literature review, passive Google Scholar alerts)
- **Alternative Focus:** Black Mirror Phase 1 (attention economy, notification addiction, surveillance normalization have larger effects 0.3-0.8 SD, stronger foundations)

### ‚ùå REJECTED (1 system)

**Autonomous Weapon Degradation Curves** (NO-GO / REJECT)
- **Plan:** `/plans/completed/rejected/autonomous-weapons-rejection-rationale.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 3, pp. 42-58)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 3.9: FATAL CONTRADICTIONS, pp. 27-38)
- **Why Rejected:**
  - **Research 2-4 years obsolete:** 2018-2022 studies pre-date 2023-2024 AI autonomy surge (Ukraine war, swarm technology)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #1 (Reliability):** Research claims degradation; reality shows AI improves success rates 70-80% vs. 10-20% human-controlled (4-7x improvement)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #2 (Operator Ratios):** Research assumes 1:1; reality achieves 1:100+ with swarm technology (Sweden/Saab March 2025, Pentagon Replicator Aug 2025)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #3 (Energy):** Research uses static 1.5-2 hours; reality shows 10%/year incremental improvement + solid-state batteries 2027 (40-100% capacity increase)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #4 (Human Oversight):** Research assumes human-in-the-loop required; reality shows military pushing to human-on-the-loop (NORAD 2020, time-critical exemptions in DoD Directive 3000.09)
- **Core Problem:** Research foundation is **180-DEGREE OPPOSITE** of 2023-2024 reality (AI improves reliability, not degrades)
- **Alternative Considered:** Reconceptualize as "swarm logistics" (production, deployment tempo, replacement) NOT individual degradation
  - Timeline: 6-9 months (major redesign from scratch)
  - Prerequisites: Commission 2023-2025 military autonomy research review (20-40 hours)
  - Recommendation: **ONLY pursue if stakeholder insists AND resources available**
- **Final Disposition:** REJECT from current roadmap
- **Revisit Timeline:** 2028-2030 (3-5 years, if field stabilizes or new research commissioned)
- **Archived:** `/plans/completed/rejected/autonomous-weapons-rejection-rationale.md`
- **Lesson Learned:** Fast-moving fields (AI, military tech) require recent research (2023-2025), not 2018-2022. 2-4 year gap is FATAL when field changes faster than publication cycle.

**Net Impact on Roadmap:**
- **+12-16 hours:** Digital Consciousness Governance (new medium-priority feature)
- **-0 hours:** Performative Behavior (deferred, no current work‚Äîmonitoring only ~4h/year)
- **-0 hours:** Autonomous Weapons (rejected, never allocated)
- **Total Phase 3 commitment:** 12-16 hours over 3-4 months

## Development Standards

**Every mechanic requires:**
1. Research Citations (2+ peer-reviewed sources, 2024-2025 preferred)
2. Parameter Justification (why this number? backed by data)
3. Mechanism Description (how it works, not just effects)
4. Interaction Map (what affects/is affected)
5. Expected Timeline (early/mid/late game)
6. Failure Modes (what can go wrong)
7. Test Validation (Monte Carlo evidence)

**Development Workflow:**
1. Research Phase ‚Üí Create plan with citations
2. Design Phase ‚Üí Define state, mechanics, interactions
3. Implementation Phase ‚Üí Code, integrate, log, test
4. Validation Phase ‚Üí Monte Carlo (N‚â•10)
5. Documentation Phase ‚Üí Wiki, devlog, roadmap

**Balance Philosophy:** NO tuning for "fun" - this is a research tool. If model shows 90% extinction ‚Üí DOCUMENT WHY. If 50% Utopia ‚Üí DOCUMENT WHY.
