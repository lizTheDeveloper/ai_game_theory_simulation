# Master Implementation Roadmap
## AI Alignment Game Theory Simulation

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Purpose:** Active work items only - completed work in `/plans/completed/`
**Philosophy:** Research-backed realism, mechanism-driven emergence

---

## Research-Backed Realism

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Research First:** Every mechanic backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research
2. **Mechanisms Over Balance:** Set parameters to real-world values, don't tune for "fun"
3. **Emergence:** Allow unexpected outcomes to emerge from interactions
4. **Documentation:** Every system has research citations

---

### AI-Assisted Skills Enhancement (~78 hours, 3 months)

**Based on:** Super-alignment researcher findings + research skeptic validation
**Status:** Core system validated (TRL 8-9), critical gaps identified
**Research Foundation:** 22 peer-reviewed studies (Science, Nature, ACM, OECD)
**Full Research:** `reviews/bionic-skills-hopeful-research-foundation-20251016.md`

**What's Correct (Keep):**
- ‚úÖ AI amplification via digital tools (Copilot, ChatGPT) - NOT BCIs
- ‚úÖ Differential benefits by skill level (novices gain MORE)
- ‚úÖ Digital divide & access inequality
- ‚úÖ Task-specific effects

**Critical Gaps (Must Add):**

  Separate AI-assisted performance from true skill retention, scaffolding effects
  ‚Üí See: `plans/bionic-skills-competence-tracking.md`
  ‚Üí Research: Cognitive Research (2024) "illusion of understanding", MDPI (2023) deskilling

  Model productivity-wage gap, labor vs capital capture, policy interventions
  ‚Üí See: `plans/bionic-skills-economic-distribution.md`
  ‚Üí Research: Brookings (2024), EPI (productivity +77%, wages +12% since 1973)
  ‚Üí Impact: CRITICAL - model overly optimistic about worker benefits

- [ ] **Phase 5: Validation & Testing** (Month 2, 16h)
  Historical comparisons (ATMs, Excel), sensitivity analysis, literature validation
  ‚Üí See: `plans/bionic-skills-research-grounding.md` (Section: Phase 5)

## Development Standards

**Every mechanic requires:**
1. Research Citations (2+ peer-reviewed sources, 2024-2025 preferred)
2. Parameter Justification (why this number? backed by data)
3. Mechanism Description (how it works, not just effects)
4. Interaction Map (what affects/is affected)
5. Expected Timeline (early/mid/late game)
6. Failure Modes (what can go wrong)
7. Test Validation (Monte Carlo evidence)

**Development Workflow:**
1. Research Phase ‚Üí Create plan with citations
2. Design Phase ‚Üí Define state, mechanics, interactions
3. Implementation Phase ‚Üí Code, integrate, log, test
4. Validation Phase ‚Üí Monte Carlo (N‚â•10)
5. Documentation Phase ‚Üí Wiki, devlog, roadmap

**Balance Philosophy:** NO tuning for "fun" - this is a research tool. If model shows 90% extinction ‚Üí DOCUMENT WHY. If 50% Utopia ‚Üí DOCUMENT WHY.
