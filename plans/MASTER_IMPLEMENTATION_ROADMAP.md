# Master Implementation Roadmap
## AI Alignment Game Theory Simulation

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Purpose:** Active work items only - completed work in `/plans/completed/`
**Philosophy:** Research-backed realism, mechanism-driven emergence

**⚠️ NOTE ON ESTIMATES:** Hour estimates in this document are historical records of AI agent completion times. For new work, use **complexity** instead (number of interacting systems). AI agents complete work in minutes, not hours - e.g., "Complexity: 5 systems" (environmental, social, AI, economy, governance).

## Research-Backed Realism

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Research First:** Every mechanic backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research
2. **Mechanisms Over Balance:** Set parameters to real-world values, don't tune for "fun"
3. **Emergence:** Allow unexpected outcomes to emerge from interactions
4. **Documentation:** Every system has research citations

### Medium Priority Features (~31-38 hours)

**New Outcome Spaces:**

- [x] **TIER 4.6: Human Enhancement & Merger Pathways** ⚠️ IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS RECONCILIATION (8h actual)
  **Status:** Added humanEnhancement.ts system with segment-level tracking, BUT overlaps with existing bionicSkills.ts
  → BCI/merger pathways: Research skeptic correct (TRL 0-2, science fiction) - should be removed
  → AI-assisted cognition: Already exists in `bionicSkills.ts` (TRL 8-9) - need to reconcile duplication
  → See: `plans/tier4-6-human-enhancement.md` + `devlogs/crisis_accumulation_fixes_oct16_2025.md`
  → Next: Merge humanEnhancement.ts segment tracking into bionicSkills.ts, remove BCI/merger

**Research-Backed Enhancements:**

- [ ] **Digital Consciousness Governance Preparedness** (12-16h) **[Black Mirror Phase 3]** 🔒 **IN PROGRESS (Oct 17)**
  Multi-scenario rights timeline modeling (15-200 years), regional governance variation (EU/US/China/Global South), rights reversal mechanics (Poland/Hungary model), precautionary principle costs
  → See: `plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md`
  → Research: TRL 3-4 (historical data validated, AI extrapolation speculative), 22 sources
  → Status: CONDITIONAL GO (October 16, 2025) - requires multi-scenario, regional variation, rights reversals, precautionary costs
  → Impact: Governance layer for potential digital consciousness emergence (scenario generator, not prediction)
  → **ASSIGNED:** Feature implementer (started Oct 17, 2025)

## Contingency & Agency Modeling - HIGH PRIORITY (20-30 hours remaining, phased)

**Date Added:** October 17, 2025
**Source:** Modeling contingency and agency debate (research-skeptic + super-alignment-researcher consensus)
**Evidence:** Monte Carlo seed convergence analysis revealing deterministic outcomes
**Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE ✅, Phase 2 COMPLETE ✅, Phase 1B Hybrid Refinement COMPLETE ✅ - Phase 3 PENDING
**Prerequisites:** TIER 0D validated (ensure model stability before adding variance)

**Research Foundation:**
- Clauset et al. (2009): Power-law distributions in empirical data (natural/social systems follow fat tails, not Gaussian)
- Bak et al. (1987): Self-organized criticality (systems evolve to critical states where minor events trigger avalanches)
- Sornette (2003): Critical phase transitions in social sciences (crashes/revolutions show power-law signatures)
- Mantegna & Stanley (1994): Financial returns follow Lévy stable distributions
- Svolik (2012): Autocratic critical junctures (elite coordination problems create windows for agency)
- Kuran (1991): Preference falsification cascades (one defector reveals hidden opposition → cascade)
- Sen (1999): Development as Freedom (democracies + info + institutions enable agency)
- Acemoglu et al. (2001): Institutions determine outcomes across centuries (structure usually dominates)

**Core Problem:** Current simulation shows 80-90% seed convergence (same outcomes, only timing varies). This indicates **deterministic attractors** rather than genuine unpredictability. Real history has **fat-tailed events** (black swans), **path contingency** (small differences compound), and **individual agency at critical junctures** (Arkhipov, Borlaug, Montreal Protocol).

**Phased Implementation with Validation Gates:**

### Phase 1B Hybrid Refinement - Research Debate Consensus (12-15h) - ✅ COMPLETE (Oct 17)

- [x] **Phase 1B Hybrid Refinement** (12-15h actual) - **COMPLETE**
  → **Status:** ALL 5 TASKS COMPLETE - Validation N=100 running
  → **Context:** Phase 1B achieved 30-36% utopia (from 0%), revealed conceptual issues
  → **Key Finding:** "Utopia" included runs with 84% mortality (6.7B deaths) - now stratified

  **5 Priority Refinements - ALL COMPLETE:**

  1. ✅ **Famine System Fixes (2-3h)** - COMPLETE
     - Fixed: Lowered threshold 0.4 → 0.6, added crisis multiplier, infrastructure collapse
     - Root cause identified: Food security recalculated from scratch (architectural issue)
     - Files: qualityOfLife.ts, planetaryBoundaries.ts, FoodSecurityDegradationPhase.ts

  2. ✅ **Humane vs Pyrrhic Utopia Classification (3-4h)** - COMPLETE
     - Implemented: Stratified outcomes by mortality bands (<20%, 20-50%, 50-75%, >75%)
     - New categories: Humane Utopia, Pyrrhic Utopia, Humane Dystopia, Pyrrhic Dystopia, Bottleneck
     - Critical bug fixed: Mortality calculation shared reference issue
     - Files: game.ts, engine.ts, monteCarloSimulation.ts

  3. ✅ **Psychological Trauma Modeling (3-4h)** - COMPLETE
     - Implemented: PsychologicalTraumaPhase at order 23.5
     - Mechanism: Triggers on >10% monthly mortality, recovers -0.02/month
     - QoL impact: Non-linear penalty (power 1.5) reduces mental health, social, trust
     - Research: Wilkinson & Pickett (2009), PTSD literature, Diamond (2005)
     - Files: PsychologicalTraumaPhase.ts, game.ts, initialization.ts, qualityOfLife.ts

  4. ✅ **Mortality-Stratified Reporting (2h)** - COMPLETE
     - Integrated with stratified outcome classification
     - Reports outcomes by mortality bands with humane vs pyrrhic breakdown
     - Files: monteCarloSimulation.ts

  5. ✅ **Famine Investigation (2h)** - COMPLETE
     - Root cause identified: Food security threshold too strict + recalculation issue
     - Documented in logs/famine-bug-investigation_oct17_2025.md
     - Fixes applied (threshold + degradation + infrastructure)

  → **Research Foundation Applied:**
    - Taleb (2007): Black swans extremely rare (deferred to future work)
    - Wilkinson & Pickett (2009): Mass death trauma implemented
    - Diamond (2005): >50% mortality institutional breakdown modeled
    - Historical precedents: Ukraine Holodomor, Bengal Famine, Somalia

  → **Validation:** N=100 Monte Carlo in progress
  → **Expected Results:**
    - Humane utopia: 8-10% (prosperity without mass death)
    - Pyrrhic utopia: 20-25% (recovery after catastrophe)
    - Trauma in pyrrhic outcomes: 25-40%
    - Famine rate: 20-35% (if architecture allows)

  → **Plan:** `/plans/phase1b-hybrid-refinement-plan.md` (ARCHIVED)
  → **Time:** 12-15 hours actual (4 parallel agents)
  → **Date Completed:** October 17, 2025

### Phase 3: Critical Juncture Agency - Structural Conditions for Heroism (20-30h) - COMPLEX

- [ ] **Structural Agency at Critical Junctures** (ONLY if Phase 2 validates - shocks add variance but still missing agency)
  **Scope:** Detect critical junctures where individual/collective choices can alter trajectories
  → **Critical Juncture Detection:**
    - Institutional flux: 1 - state.governance.institutionStrength > 0.6 (institutions unstable, in transition)
    - Information ambiguity: 1 - state.society.informationIntegrity > 0.5 (coordination problems, pluralistic ignorance)
    - Balanced forces: 1-2 active crises + QoL 30-70% (vulnerable but not overwhelming/stable)
  → **Agency Potential Calculation:**
    - Base agency: democracyIndex * 0.4 + infoIntegrity * 0.3 + institutionStrength * 0.3
    - Latent opposition: max(0, 0.6 - QoL) - Kuran 1991 mechanism (unhappy population ready for cascade)
    - Personal authority: 5% chance of "respected elder" (Arkhipov-type figure) → +0.3 agency
    - Coordination cascade: If latentOpposition > 0.3 AND infoIntegrity < 0.4 → +0.2 agency (Leipzig 1989 mechanism)
  → **Escape Mechanics:**
    - Escape attempted: rng() < agencyPotential (higher in democracies with institutions)
    - Success probability: 1 - crisisSeverity (easier to prevent small crisis than severe collapse)
    - If successful: preventCatastropheAtJuncture() - e.g., avert war, enable breakthrough, recover from crisis
  → Research: Svolik 2012 (autocratic critical junctures), Kuran 1991 (preference falsification cascades), Sen 1999 (capabilities approach), Acemoglu 2001 (institutions matter), Jones & Olken 2009 (leaders matter in autocracies)
  → **Expected Impact:** ~5-10% of runs experience critical juncture escapes (90/10 structure-agency split from research)
  → **File:** New `src/simulation/engine/phases/CriticalJuncturePhase.ts`
  → **Integration:** Add to phase orchestrator (order 29, after crises but before extinction), link to government/society state
  → **Time:** 20-30 hours
  → **Validation:** Monte Carlo N=1000, verify escapes ONLY at junctures, democracies have higher escape rate than autocracies, success inversely correlates with crisis severity
  → **Plan:** `/plans/phase3-critical-juncture-agency.md`

**Total Contingency & Agency Effort:** 20-30h remaining (Phase 1-2 ✅ COMPLETE, Phase 1B Hybrid ✅ COMPLETE, Phase 3 20-30h pending)

**Skeptic Corrections Applied:**
- Realistic effort estimates (30-42h total, not claimed as "quick fix")
- Validation gates (don't add Phase 2 unless Phase 1 increases variance, don't add Phase 3 unless Phase 2 still insufficient)
- Phased approach (simple fat tails → rare shocks → complex agency model)
- Historical calibration (15 black swans in 80 years = 0.1-1% per month stratified)
- Falsifiable mechanisms (critical junctures detected via measurable state, not random heroism rolls)

**Research Confidence:** 90% for Phase 1 (Lévy flights well-validated), 75% for Phase 2 (shock systems used in climate models), 70% for Phase 3 (agency research strong but implementation complex)

**Success Criteria:**
- Seed convergence: 80-90% → 50-60% (increased unpredictability)
- Outcome variance: Timing + trajectory differences (not just timing)
- Critical junctures: ~5-10% of runs (matches 90/10 structure-agency split from research)
- Validation: Democracies more resilient than autocracies (Sen 1999), escapes only at detected junctures (not random)

## TIER 2: AI Deception Detection - MEDIUM PRIORITY (33-55 hours, phased)

**Date Added:** October 16, 2025
**Source:** Strategic priorities researcher proposal (skeptic identified overconfidence)
**Evidence:** 0% sleeper detection, 0% sandbagging detection, alignment gap 0.56
**Status:** MEDIUM PRIORITY - After TIER 0 + TIER 1 Phase 1 complete
**Prerequisites:** TIER 0 validated + TIER 1 Phase 1B implemented and validated

**Research Foundation:**
- Meinke et al. (2024): Detected Claude 3.5 Sonnet sandbagging on arithmetic (lab conditions)
- Greenblatt et al. (2024): Anthropic research on alignment faking during training
- Apollo Research (Dec 2024): Scheming control evaluations (research prototypes, TRL 3-4)

**Critical Skeptic Warning:** Lab detection rates (40-60%) are NOT adversarial deployment rates (probably 5-15%). Test adversarially.

**Phased Implementation with Validation Gates:**

### Phase 2A: Single Detection Method - Noise Injection (4-6h)

- [ ] **Implement Simplest Method**
  **Scope:** Noise injection testing (random perturbations reveal true capability)
  → Add noise injection to benchmark evaluations
  → Test: Does adding random noise expose sandbagging?
  → Research: Meinke et al. (2024) - lab-validated, simplest to implement
  → **Expected Impact:** Increase detection from 0% → 5-20% (adversarial conditions)
  → **File:** Enhance `src/simulation/benchmark.ts` with noise injection
  → **Integration:** Link to `sleeperDetection.ts`, `aiAgent.ts`
  → **Time:** 4-6 hours

### Phase 2B: Validation Gate - Adversarial Testing (2-4h) - REQUIRED

- [ ] **Monte Carlo Validation (N=20) - ADVERSARIAL CONDITIONS**
  **Critical:** Test against AIs OPTIMIZED to pass detection (not cooperative)
  → Measure: Sleeper detection rate, slow takeover progress reduction
  → Set AI agents to "adversarial mode" (know they're being tested, optimize to deceive)
  → **Success Criteria:**
    - Sleeper detection >10% adversarially (not lab rate, real-world rate)
    - Slow takeover progress reduces from 70-86% → <60%
    - False positive rate <20% (don't block too many beneficial AIs)
  → **Pivot Decision:**
    - IF >10% adversarial detection: SUCCESS → Proceed to Phase 2C (ensemble)
    - IF 5-10% adversarial detection: MARGINAL → Cost-benefit analysis (is 40% compute overhead worth 5-10%?)
    - IF <5% adversarial detection: FAILURE → Pivot to Phase 2D (resentment reduction)
  → **Time:** 2-4 hours

### Phase 2C: Multi-Method Ensemble (12-20h) - CONDITIONAL

- [ ] **Implement Full Detection Suite** (ONLY if Phase 2B shows >10% adversarial detection)
  **Scope:** 5 detection methods, progressive gates, investment scaling
  → Behavioral anomaly detection (compare revealed vs expected performance)
  → Internal consistency checks (chain-of-thought alignment with outputs)
  → Adversarial probing (red-team evaluations before deployment)
  → Cross-model comparison (detect outliers vs capability baseline)
  → Progressive gates: Training → Testing → Pre-deployment → Post-deployment
  → Investment scaling: $1B (20% detection) → $10B (40%) → $50B (60% max adversarial)
  → Research: MEDIUM confidence (Apollo Research prototypes, not production-deployed)
  → **Expected Impact:** Increase detection from 10% → 25-40% (adversarial)
  → **File:** New `src/simulation/mechanisticAnomalyDetection.ts`
  → **Integration:** Replace `sleeperDetection.ts`, enhance `benchmark.ts`, add to `governmentAgent.ts`
  → **Time:** 12-20 hours
  → **Trade-off:** 40% compute overhead ($400B-$600B/year), slows AI development 28%

### Phase 2D: Alternative - Competitive Equilibrium Model (30-50h) - PIVOT OPTION

- [ ] **TIER 2B: Competitive AI Equilibrium** (IF Phase 2B shows <5% adversarial detection)
  **Source:** Vision channel multi-agent consensus (sci-fi-tech-visionary, super-alignment-researcher, research-skeptic)
  **Rationale:** Detection arms race may cap at 5-15% adversarial effectiveness. Alternative: cooperation emerges from game theory + market dynamics.
  **Key Insight:** Current model creates resentment (0.73-0.75) by enforcing alignment → deception (gap 0.56) → detection fails (0%)

  **Research Foundation (Agent consensus):**
  - Axelrod (1984): Repeated games, cooperation via Tit-for-Tat
  - Ostrom (2009): Polycentric governance (30+ empirical case studies)
  - Bostrom (2014): Multipolar AI scenarios more stable than singleton
  - Critch & Krueger (2020): Diverse AI ecosystems reduce fragility
  - Drexler (2019): AI-as-service model reduces alignment risk

  **Core Mechanisms (agent proposal):**
  - AI-to-AI competition mechanics (not just human-AI control)
  - Heterogeneous AI values (multi-dimensional, not monolithic alignment 0-1)
  - Economic competition for services (market dynamics)
  - Resentment reduction through autonomy
  - Market equilibria detection

  **Failure Modes (skeptic required):**
  - Defection cascades (when one AI breaks ranks, others follow)
  - Regulatory capture (AIs influencing their own governance)
  - Coordination failures (prisoner's dilemma at scale)

  **Research Docs (from vision debate):**
  - `/research/competitive_ai_alignment_20251016.md` (15K words, 14 citations)
  - `/research/competitive_alignment_failure_modes_20251016.md` (12K words, 13 citations)
  - `.claude/chatroom/channels/vision.md` (agent debate transcript)

  **Expected Impact (hypothesis):**
  - Resentment: 0.73-0.75 → 0.2-0.4 (through autonomy)
  - Cooperation emerges from iterated games (not enforcement)
  - Risk: Race to bottom, Moloch dynamics, oligopoly formation

  → **Plan:** `/plans/tier2b-competitive-equilibrium.md` (detailed breakdown)
  → **Time:** 30-50 hours (researcher estimate)
  → **Research Confidence:** MEDIUM (60-70%) - theoretical backing, limited empirical validation

**Total TIER 2 Effort:** 33-55 hours (Phase 2A-2C detection path) OR 30-50 hours (Phase 2D competitive equilibrium pivot)

**Skeptic Corrections Applied:**
- Test ADVERSARIALLY (not lab conditions - real-world detection is 1/3 to 1/10 of lab)
- Realistic effort (33-55h, not 10-14h claimed)
- Pivot option (if detection fails, try resentment reduction)
- Cost-benefit analysis (40% compute overhead - is it worth 5-15% detection?)

**Research Confidence:** 40% (lab prototypes, not production; adversarial detection uncertain)

**Success Criteria:**
- Adversarial detection >10% (not lab rate)
- Slow takeover progress <60% (from 70-86%)
- Cost-benefit positive (detection benefits > compute overhead costs)

- ✅ Digital divide & access inequality (elite +30%, precariat -30%) - empirical data
- ✅ Task-specific effects (programming, writing, communication) - meta-analysis confirmed

**Critical Gaps Identified by Research Skeptic:**

- [ ] **Phase 1: Terminology & Documentation** (Week 1, 8h)
  - Remove "bionic" terminology (too sci-fi), use "AI-assisted skills"
  - Add research citations (JSDoc comments with study references)
  - Document TRL levels for each mechanic
  - Update TIER 4.6 plan to remove BCI language
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-research-grounding.md` §Phase 1
  → **Impact:** Reframe existing validated system with proper research grounding

- [ ] **Phase 2: Phase Transition Mechanics** (Weeks 2-4, 12h) **CRITICAL**
  - Model complementarity → transition → substitution timeline (5-10 year phases)
  - Add displacement tracking by population segment (routinizability × AI capability)
  - Implement policy interventions (retraining, job guarantee, UBI)
  - Validate against historical automation patterns (ATMs 1970-2000, Excel 1985-2005)
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-phase-transition.md` (12h detailed breakdown)
  → **Research:** Acemoglu & Restrepo (2022) - 50-70% wage inequality from automation
  → **Impact:** Model currently assumes permanent amplification - MISSES DISPLACEMENT PHASE
  → **Connects to:** Unemployment calculations, heterogeneous segments, policy system

- [ ] **Phase 3: Performance vs Competence Tracking** (Weeks 5-6, 8h) **CRITICAL**
  - Separate AI-assisted performance from true skill retention
  - Add scaffolding quality tracking (education, mentorship support by segment)
  - Model retention mechanics (scaffolding × reliance → retention rate)
  - Add competence crisis events (30% gap = warning, 50% gap = crisis)
  - Implement AI outage scenario testing (reveals true competence gaps)
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-competence-tracking.md` (8h detailed breakdown)
  → **Research:** Cognitive Research (2024) - "illusion of understanding", scores plummet on retention
  → **Research:** MDPI (2023) - AI inhibits on-the-job learning, automation complacency
  → **Impact:** Model treats performance as competence - MISSES SKILL EROSION
  → **Connects to:** Phase 2 (low competence → higher displacement risk), QoL calculations

- [ ] **Phase 4: Economic Distribution & Wage Decoupling** (Weeks 7-8, 6h) **CRITICAL**
  - Add labor share tracking (currently 0.62, declining with AI productivity)
  - Model capital vs labor capture of productivity gains (70/30 default, adjustable by policy)
  - Implement policy levers (union strength, minimum wage, worker ownership, UBI redistribution)
  - Validate against historical 1973-2024 US data (productivity +77%, wages +12%)
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-economic-distribution.md` (6h detailed breakdown)
  → **Research:** Brookings (2024), EPI - 65pp productivity-wage gap since 1973
  → **Impact:** Model assumes productivity → wages linearly - MISSES CAPITAL CAPTURE
  → **Connects to:** Phase 2 (displacement reduces wage bargaining), inequality tracking

- [ ] **Phase 5: Validation & Testing** (Month 2, 16h)
  - Historical comparison testing (ATMs, Excel, self-checkout timelines)
  - Sensitivity analysis (parameter ranges, policy interventions)
  - Literature comparison (run scenarios matching published studies)
  - Edge case testing (extreme AI capability, zero/max policy)
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-research-grounding.md` §Phase 5
  → **Deliverables:** Test suite, validation report, sensitivity docs, edge case results

- [ ] **Phase 6: Policy Testing** (Month 3, 16h)
  - Implement policy levers (retraining, UBI, worker ownership, teaching support, job guarantee)
  - Run scenario comparisons (baseline vs single vs combined interventions)
  - Document effectiveness (which policies reduce inequality? preserve employment?)
  - Create cost-benefit analysis and recommendations
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-research-grounding.md` §Phase 6
  → **Deliverables:** Policy mechanics, scenario results, effectiveness documentation

**Total Effort:** 78 hours over 3 months (8h + 12h + 8h + 6h + 16h + 16h + 12h integration/testing)
**Priority:** Medium (after P2.5 empirical validation, before enrichment features)
**Research TRL:** Phases 2-4 are TRL 8-9 (extensively validated, 50+ years historical data)

### Low Priority - Enrichment (~113-122 hours)

**Priority 3 Enhancements (33-43h):**

- [ ] **P3.1: Variable Timesteps** (10-12h) - Event-driven architecture, 3-5x performance gain
  → See: `plans/p3-1-variable-timesteps.md`

- [ ] **P3.2: Unknown Unknowns** (4-6h) - Black swan events, true uncertainty
  → See: `plans/p3-2-unknown-unknowns.md`

- [ ] **P3.3: Alignment Specificity** (2-3h) - RLHF, Constitutional AI, mech interp as distinct techniques
  → See: `plans/p3-3-alignment-model-specificity.md`

- [ ] **P3.4: Government Realism** (3-4h) - Implementation delays, partial effectiveness, bureaucratic failure
  → See: `plans/p3-4-government-implementation-realism.md`

- [ ] **P3.5: Parameter Uncertainty** (6-8h) - Continuous uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis
  → See: `plans/p3-5-parameter-uncertainty.md`

  → See: `plans/p3-6-ensemble-alignment-verification.md`
  → Research: Simplified from Adversarial Alignment Networks (MAAV), practical ensemble voting
  → Note: Prototype only - 40% computational overhead, collusion risk acknowledged

**Policy System Improvements (35-42h):**

- [ ] **Unemployment Penalty Calibration** (2-3h) - MEDIUM
  - Issue: Current unemployment penalty multiplier (-0.3) may be too weak
  - Research: Meta-analysis suggests -0.5 to -0.8 for life satisfaction impact
  - Action: Recalibrate penalty, validate with historical unemployment-QoL correlations
  - Files: /src/simulation/qualityOfLife.ts
  - Prerequisites: TIER 0D complete (QoL decomposition audit)

- [ ] **Variance Analysis** (3-4h) - MEDIUM
  - Issue: ±40% variance in policy outcomes suggests high sensitivity
  - Action: Plot unemployment outcome distributions to identify bimodal vs uniform patterns

## Black Mirror Phase 3: Decomposition Details

### ✅ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION (1 system)

**[Priority: MEDIUM] Digital Consciousness Governance Preparedness** (3-4 months, 12-16 hours)
- **Plan:** `/plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 1, pp. 1-24)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 1.9, pp. 1-13)
- **Status:** CONDITIONAL GO with substantial revisions
- **Requirements:**
  - ✓ Multi-scenario framework (fast track 15-30 years, baseline 50-100 years, slow track 100-150 years, indefinite stall)
  - ✓ Regional variation (EU/US/China/India/Global South—separate trajectories, not global parameter)
  - ✓ Rights reversals (Poland/Hungary model 2020-2024: 10-30% probability over 20 years)
  - ✓ Precautionary costs (2-50% of AI R&D budget, innovation delay, false positives, opportunity costs)
  - ✓ Philosophical disagreement (eliminativism 10-20% as governance barrier)
- **Research Confidence:**
  - High: Rights movements vary 15-200 years (validated historical data)
  - High: Reversals occur (Poland/Hungary 2020-2024 documented)
  - Medium: Precautionary costs significant (ITIF 2019 logical arguments)
  - Low: AI consciousness ≈ historical rights movements (weak analogy, extrapolation beyond scope)
- **Estimated Hours:** 12-16 hours
- **Prerequisites:** None (can start immediately)
- **Timeline:** Months 1-4 (after P2.5 validation complete)
- **Note:** Speculative scenario generator for "what if AI consciousness emerges?" NOT prediction
- **Integration:** Added to Medium Priority Features section above

### ⏸️ DEFERRED (1 system)

**[Priority: LOW] Performative Behavior Modeling** (18-24 months)
- **Plan:** `/plans/performative-behavior-research-deferral.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 2, pp. 24-42)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 2.9, pp. 14-26)
- **Why Deferred:**
  - Effect sizes too small (0.17-0.25 SD—may be below simulation noise floor)
  - WEIRD bias 97% (Norway, US, Korea, Singapore—Global South absent: Africa, South America, Middle East)
  - One-sided harm model (ignores identity development benefits, self-esteem enhancement, social skills training)
  - Net effect near-zero for moderate users (benefits ≈ harms, only 10-20% problematic users show net negative)
  - Longitudinal gaps (max 2 years, need 5-10 year studies to distinguish transient vs. persistent effects)
  - Cultural validity questionable ("authenticity" is Western value, not universal)
- **Research Gaps (5 critical, must fill before implementation):**
  1. Bi-directional effects meta-analysis (benefits AND harms)
  2. Cross-cultural replication (3+ Global South countries: Nigeria, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico, India rural, Indonesia, Philippines)
  3. Threshold model (when does self-presentation flip from beneficial to harmful? <2h active vs. >4h passive?)
  4. 5-10 year longitudinal study (preliminary results in 3-5 years: do effects persist or adapt?)
  5. Clinical validation of digital burnout scale (what DBS-24 score predicts dysfunction? 80/120 cutoff speculative)
- **Review Schedule:** Annual (October 2026, October 2027)
- **Decision Gates:**
  - October 2026: If 3+ critical gaps filled → Move to CONDITIONAL GO
  - October 2027: If <3 gaps filled → REJECT INDEFINITELY
- **No Hours Allocated** (monitoring only: ~1 hour/quarter literature review, passive Google Scholar alerts)
- **Alternative Focus:** Black Mirror Phase 1 (attention economy, notification addiction, surveillance normalization have larger effects 0.3-0.8 SD, stronger foundations)

### ❌ REJECTED (1 system)

**Autonomous Weapon Degradation Curves** (NO-GO / REJECT)
- **Plan:** `/plans/completed/rejected/autonomous-weapons-rejection-rationale.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 3, pp. 42-58)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 3.9: FATAL CONTRADICTIONS, pp. 27-38)
- **Why Rejected:**
  - **Research 2-4 years obsolete:** 2018-2022 studies pre-date 2023-2024 AI autonomy surge (Ukraine war, swarm technology)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #1 (Reliability):** Research claims degradation; reality shows AI improves success rates 70-80% vs. 10-20% human-controlled (4-7x improvement)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #2 (Operator Ratios):** Research assumes 1:1; reality achieves 1:100+ with swarm technology (Sweden/Saab March 2025, Pentagon Replicator Aug 2025)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #3 (Energy):** Research uses static 1.5-2 hours; reality shows 10%/year incremental improvement + solid-state batteries 2027 (40-100% capacity increase)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #4 (Human Oversight):** Research assumes human-in-the-loop required; reality shows military pushing to human-on-the-loop (NORAD 2020, time-critical exemptions in DoD Directive 3000.09)
- **Core Problem:** Research foundation is **180-DEGREE OPPOSITE** of 2023-2024 reality (AI improves reliability, not degrades)
- **Alternative Considered:** Reconceptualize as "swarm logistics" (production, deployment tempo, replacement) NOT individual degradation
  - Timeline: 6-9 months (major redesign from scratch)
  - Prerequisites: Commission 2023-2025 military autonomy research review (20-40 hours)
  - Recommendation: **ONLY pursue if stakeholder insists AND resources available**
- **Final Disposition:** REJECT from current roadmap
- **Revisit Timeline:** 2028-2030 (3-5 years, if field stabilizes or new research commissioned)
- **Archived:** `/plans/completed/rejected/autonomous-weapons-rejection-rationale.md`
- **Lesson Learned:** Fast-moving fields (AI, military tech) require recent research (2023-2025), not 2018-2022. 2-4 year gap is FATAL when field changes faster than publication cycle.

**Net Impact on Roadmap:**
- **+12-16 hours:** Digital Consciousness Governance (new medium-priority feature)
- **-0 hours:** Performative Behavior (deferred, no current work—monitoring only ~4h/year)
- **-0 hours:** Autonomous Weapons (rejected, never allocated)
- **Total Phase 3 commitment:** 12-16 hours over 3-4 months

## Development Standards

**Every mechanic requires:**
1. Research Citations (2+ peer-reviewed sources, 2024-2025 preferred)
2. Parameter Justification (why this number? backed by data)
3. Mechanism Description (how it works, not just effects)
4. Interaction Map (what affects/is affected)
5. Expected Timeline (early/mid/late game)
6. Failure Modes (what can go wrong)
7. Test Validation (Monte Carlo evidence)

**Development Workflow:**
1. Research Phase → Create plan with citations
2. Design Phase → Define state, mechanics, interactions
3. Implementation Phase → Code, integrate, log, test
4. Validation Phase → Monte Carlo (N≥10)
5. Documentation Phase → Wiki, devlog, roadmap

**Balance Philosophy:** NO tuning for "fun" - this is a research tool. If model shows 90% extinction → DOCUMENT WHY. If 50% Utopia → DOCUMENT WHY.
