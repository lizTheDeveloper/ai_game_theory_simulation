# Master Implementation Roadmap
## AI Alignment Game Theory Simulation

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Purpose:** Active work items only - completed work in `/plans/completed/`
**Philosophy:** Research-backed realism, mechanism-driven emergence

## Research-Backed Realism

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Research First:** Every mechanic backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research
2. **Mechanisms Over Balance:** Set parameters to real-world values, don't tune for "fun"
3. **Emergence:** Allow unexpected outcomes to emerge from interactions
4. **Documentation:** Every system has research citations

## Development Standards

**Every mechanic requires:**
1. Research Citations (2+ peer-reviewed sources, 2024-2025 preferred)
2. Parameter Justification (why this number? backed by data)
3. Mechanism Description (how it works, not just effects)
4. Interaction Map (what affects/is affected)
5. Expected Timeline (early/mid/late game)
6. Failure Modes (what can go wrong)
7. Test Validation (Monte Carlo evidence)

**Development Workflow:**
1. Research Phase â†’ Create plan with citations
2. Design Phase â†’ Define state, mechanics, interactions
3. Implementation Phase â†’ Code, integrate, log, test
4. Validation Phase â†’ Monte Carlo (Nâ‰¥10)
5. Documentation Phase â†’ Wiki, devlog, roadmap

**Balance Philosophy:** NO tuning for "fun" - this is a research tool. If model shows 90% extinction â†’ DOCUMENT WHY. If 50% Utopia â†’ DOCUMENT WHY.
