# Master Implementation Roadmap
## AI Alignment Game Theory Simulation

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Purpose:** Active work items only - completed work in `/plans/completed/`
**Philosophy:** Research-backed realism, mechanism-driven emergence

---

## Research-Backed Realism

> "We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can - let the model show what it shows."

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Research First:** Every mechanic backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research
2. **Mechanisms Over Balance:** Set parameters to real-world values, don't tune for "fun"
3. **Emergence:** Allow unexpected outcomes to emerge from interactions
4. **Documentation:** Every system has research citations

---

## Current State Summary

### ✅ Completed & Archived

**TIER 0-3:** Baseline corrections, extinction risks, crisis mitigations, planetary boundaries
**TIER 4.1-4.5:** Tech tree (70 techs), dystopia paths, info warfare, energy/resources, population
**Priority 0 (P0):** 7 critical fixes - AI growth, bankruptcy, determinism, stochasticity (✅ 7/7 complete)
**Priority 1 (P1):** 5 high-priority fixes - death accounting, mortality rates, recovery mechanics (✅ 5/5 complete)
**Priority 2 (P2):** 6 medium improvements - environmental calibration, breakthroughs, org diversification, heterogeneous populations, simulation features, memetic evolution (✅ 6/6 complete)

**All details:** See `/plans/completed/` directory

---

---

### ✅ Priority 2 Complete (6/6)

All Priority 2 improvements are now complete and archived to `/plans/completed/`:

- [x] **P2.3: Heterogeneous Population Segments** ✅ COMPLETE (8-10h actual)
  → Plan: `plans/completed/p2-3-heterogeneous-population.md`

- [x] **P2.4: Simulation Features for Validation** ✅ COMPLETE (3h actual, Oct 16, 2025)
  → Plan: `plans/completed/p2-4-simulation-features-COMPLETE.md`
  → Detail: `plans/completed/event-trigger-system-design.md`

- [x] **P2.5: Empirical Validation** ✅ FRAMEWORK COMPLETE (4h actual, Oct 16, 2025)
  → Plan: `plans/completed/p2-5-empirical-validation-FRAMEWORK-COMPLETE.md`

- [x] **P2.6: Memetic Evolution & Polarization Dynamics** ✅ COMPLETE (10.5h actual, Oct 16, 2025)
  → Plan: `plans/completed/p2-6-memetic-polarization-dynamics-COMPLETE.md`

---

### Medium Priority Features (~31-38 hours)

**New Outcome Spaces:**

- [x] **TIER 4.6: Human Enhancement & Merger Pathways** ⚠️ IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS RECONCILIATION (8h actual)
  **Status:** Added humanEnhancement.ts system with segment-level tracking, BUT overlaps with existing bionicSkills.ts
  → BCI/merger pathways: Research skeptic correct (TRL 0-2, science fiction) - should be removed
  → AI-assisted cognition: Already exists in `bionicSkills.ts` (TRL 8-9) - need to reconcile duplication
  → See: `plans/tier4-6-human-enhancement.md` + `devlogs/crisis_accumulation_fixes_oct16_2025.md`
  → Next: Merge humanEnhancement.ts segment tracking into bionicSkills.ts, remove BCI/merger

**Research-Backed Enhancements:**

- [ ] **Digital Consciousness Governance Preparedness** (12-16h) **[Black Mirror Phase 3]**
  Multi-scenario rights timeline modeling (15-200 years), regional governance variation (EU/US/China/Global South), rights reversal mechanics (Poland/Hungary model), precautionary principle costs
  → See: `plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md`
  → Research: TRL 3-4 (historical data validated, AI extrapolation speculative), 22 sources
  → Status: CONDITIONAL GO (October 16, 2025) - requires multi-scenario, regional variation, rights reversals, precautionary costs
  → Impact: Governance layer for potential digital consciousness emergence (scenario generator, not prediction)

---

### AI-Assisted Skills Enhancement (~78 hours, 3 months)

**Based on:** Super-alignment researcher findings + research skeptic validation
**Status:** Core system validated (TRL 8-9), critical gaps identified
**Research Foundation:** 22 peer-reviewed studies (Science, Nature, ACM, OECD)

**Planning Documents:**
- **Master Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-research-grounding.md` - 6 phases, effort breakdown, integration points
- **Phase 2 Detail:** `plans/bionic-skills-phase-transition.md` - Complementarity → substitution mechanics
- **Phase 3 Detail:** `plans/bionic-skills-competence-tracking.md` - Performance vs competence gap
- **Phase 4 Detail:** `plans/bionic-skills-economic-distribution.md` - Productivity-wage decoupling

**Research Documentation:**
- **Literature Foundation:** `reviews/bionic-skills-hopeful-research-foundation-20251016.md` - 22 studies, full citations
- **Executive Summary:** `reviews/bionic-skills-research-summary-20251016.md` - Literature synthesis
- **Action Plan:** `reviews/bionic-skills-action-plan-20251016.md` - Implementation roadmap

**Current System (bionicSkills.ts) - Keep As-Is:**
- ✅ AI amplification via digital tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, AI tutors) - NOT BCIs (TRL 8-9)
- ✅ Differential benefits by skill level (novices +60%, experts +20%) - validated by RCTs
- ✅ Digital divide & access inequality (elite +30%, precariat -30%) - empirical data
- ✅ Task-specific effects (programming, writing, communication) - meta-analysis confirmed

**Critical Gaps Identified by Research Skeptic:**

- [ ] **Phase 1: Terminology & Documentation** (Week 1, 8h)
  - Remove "bionic" terminology (too sci-fi), use "AI-assisted skills"
  - Add research citations (JSDoc comments with study references)
  - Document TRL levels for each mechanic
  - Update TIER 4.6 plan to remove BCI language
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-research-grounding.md` §Phase 1
  → **Impact:** Reframe existing validated system with proper research grounding

- [ ] **Phase 2: Phase Transition Mechanics** (Weeks 2-4, 12h) **CRITICAL**
  - Model complementarity → transition → substitution timeline (5-10 year phases)
  - Add displacement tracking by population segment (routinizability × AI capability)
  - Implement policy interventions (retraining, job guarantee, UBI)
  - Validate against historical automation patterns (ATMs 1970-2000, Excel 1985-2005)
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-phase-transition.md` (12h detailed breakdown)
  → **Research:** Acemoglu & Restrepo (2022) - 50-70% wage inequality from automation
  → **Impact:** Model currently assumes permanent amplification - MISSES DISPLACEMENT PHASE
  → **Connects to:** Unemployment calculations, heterogeneous segments, policy system

- [ ] **Phase 3: Performance vs Competence Tracking** (Weeks 5-6, 8h) **CRITICAL**
  - Separate AI-assisted performance from true skill retention
  - Add scaffolding quality tracking (education, mentorship support by segment)
  - Model retention mechanics (scaffolding × reliance → retention rate)
  - Add competence crisis events (30% gap = warning, 50% gap = crisis)
  - Implement AI outage scenario testing (reveals true competence gaps)
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-competence-tracking.md` (8h detailed breakdown)
  → **Research:** Cognitive Research (2024) - "illusion of understanding", scores plummet on retention
  → **Research:** MDPI (2023) - AI inhibits on-the-job learning, automation complacency
  → **Impact:** Model treats performance as competence - MISSES SKILL EROSION
  → **Connects to:** Phase 2 (low competence → higher displacement risk), QoL calculations

- [ ] **Phase 4: Economic Distribution & Wage Decoupling** (Weeks 7-8, 6h) **CRITICAL**
  - Add labor share tracking (currently 0.62, declining with AI productivity)
  - Model capital vs labor capture of productivity gains (70/30 default, adjustable by policy)
  - Implement policy levers (union strength, minimum wage, worker ownership, UBI redistribution)
  - Validate against historical 1973-2024 US data (productivity +77%, wages +12%)
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-economic-distribution.md` (6h detailed breakdown)
  → **Research:** Brookings (2024), EPI - 65pp productivity-wage gap since 1973
  → **Impact:** Model assumes productivity → wages linearly - MISSES CAPITAL CAPTURE
  → **Connects to:** Phase 2 (displacement reduces wage bargaining), inequality tracking

- [ ] **Phase 5: Validation & Testing** (Month 2, 16h)
  - Historical comparison testing (ATMs, Excel, self-checkout timelines)
  - Sensitivity analysis (parameter ranges, policy interventions)
  - Literature comparison (run scenarios matching published studies)
  - Edge case testing (extreme AI capability, zero/max policy)
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-research-grounding.md` §Phase 5
  → **Deliverables:** Test suite, validation report, sensitivity docs, edge case results

- [ ] **Phase 6: Policy Testing** (Month 3, 16h)
  - Implement policy levers (retraining, UBI, worker ownership, teaching support, job guarantee)
  - Run scenario comparisons (baseline vs single vs combined interventions)
  - Document effectiveness (which policies reduce inequality? preserve employment?)
  - Create cost-benefit analysis and recommendations
  → **Plan:** `plans/bionic-skills-research-grounding.md` §Phase 6
  → **Deliverables:** Policy mechanics, scenario results, effectiveness documentation

**Total Effort:** 78 hours over 3 months (8h + 12h + 8h + 6h + 16h + 16h + 12h integration/testing)
**Priority:** Medium (after P2.5 empirical validation, before enrichment features)
**Research TRL:** Phases 2-4 are TRL 8-9 (extensively validated, 50+ years historical data)
**Integration Points:** Unemployment, heterogeneous segments, policy system, QoL, inequality, crisis detection
**Files Modified:** `bionicSkills.ts` (terminology), new files: `phaseTransition.ts`, `skillRetention.ts`, `economicDistribution.ts`

## Black Mirror Phase 3: Decomposition Details

### ✅ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION (1 system)

**[Priority: MEDIUM] Digital Consciousness Governance Preparedness** (3-4 months, 12-16 hours)
- **Plan:** `/plans/digital-consciousness-governance-preparedness.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 1, pp. 1-24)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 1.9, pp. 1-13)
- **Status:** CONDITIONAL GO with substantial revisions
- **Requirements:**
  - ✓ Multi-scenario framework (fast track 15-30 years, baseline 50-100 years, slow track 100-150 years, indefinite stall)
  - ✓ Regional variation (EU/US/China/India/Global South—separate trajectories, not global parameter)
  - ✓ Rights reversals (Poland/Hungary model 2020-2024: 10-30% probability over 20 years)
  - ✓ Precautionary costs (2-50% of AI R&D budget, innovation delay, false positives, opportunity costs)
  - ✓ Philosophical disagreement (eliminativism 10-20% as governance barrier)
- **Research Confidence:**
  - High: Rights movements vary 15-200 years (validated historical data)
  - High: Reversals occur (Poland/Hungary 2020-2024 documented)
  - Medium: Precautionary costs significant (ITIF 2019 logical arguments)
  - Low: AI consciousness ≈ historical rights movements (weak analogy, extrapolation beyond scope)
- **Estimated Hours:** 12-16 hours
- **Prerequisites:** None (can start immediately)
- **Timeline:** Months 1-4 (after P2.5 validation complete)
- **Note:** Speculative scenario generator for "what if AI consciousness emerges?" NOT prediction
- **Integration:** Added to Medium Priority Features section above

### ⏸️ DEFERRED (1 system)

**[Priority: LOW] Performative Behavior Modeling** (18-24 months)
- **Plan:** `/plans/performative-behavior-research-deferral.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 2, pp. 24-42)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 2.9, pp. 14-26)
- **Why Deferred:**
  - Effect sizes too small (0.17-0.25 SD—may be below simulation noise floor)
  - WEIRD bias 97% (Norway, US, Korea, Singapore—Global South absent: Africa, South America, Middle East)
  - One-sided harm model (ignores identity development benefits, self-esteem enhancement, social skills training)
  - Net effect near-zero for moderate users (benefits ≈ harms, only 10-20% problematic users show net negative)
  - Longitudinal gaps (max 2 years, need 5-10 year studies to distinguish transient vs. persistent effects)
  - Cultural validity questionable ("authenticity" is Western value, not universal)
- **Research Gaps (5 critical, must fill before implementation):**
  1. Bi-directional effects meta-analysis (benefits AND harms)
  2. Cross-cultural replication (3+ Global South countries: Nigeria, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico, India rural, Indonesia, Philippines)
  3. Threshold model (when does self-presentation flip from beneficial to harmful? <2h active vs. >4h passive?)
  4. 5-10 year longitudinal study (preliminary results in 3-5 years: do effects persist or adapt?)
  5. Clinical validation of digital burnout scale (what DBS-24 score predicts dysfunction? 80/120 cutoff speculative)
- **Review Schedule:** Annual (October 2026, October 2027)
- **Decision Gates:**
  - October 2026: If 3+ critical gaps filled → Move to CONDITIONAL GO
  - October 2027: If <3 gaps filled → REJECT INDEFINITELY
- **No Hours Allocated** (monitoring only: ~1 hour/quarter literature review, passive Google Scholar alerts)
- **Alternative Focus:** Black Mirror Phase 1 (attention economy, notification addiction, surveillance normalization have larger effects 0.3-0.8 SD, stronger foundations)

### ❌ REJECTED (1 system)

**Autonomous Weapon Degradation Curves** (NO-GO / REJECT)
- **Plan:** `/plans/completed/rejected/autonomous-weapons-rejection-rationale.md`
- **Research:** `/research/black-mirror-phase3-research-AMENDED_20251016.md` (Section 3, pp. 42-58)
- **Critique:** `/reviews/black-mirror-phase3-research-critique_20251016.md` (Section 3.9: FATAL CONTRADICTIONS, pp. 27-38)
- **Why Rejected:**
  - **Research 2-4 years obsolete:** 2018-2022 studies pre-date 2023-2024 AI autonomy surge (Ukraine war, swarm technology)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #1 (Reliability):** Research claims degradation; reality shows AI improves success rates 70-80% vs. 10-20% human-controlled (4-7x improvement)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #2 (Operator Ratios):** Research assumes 1:1; reality achieves 1:100+ with swarm technology (Sweden/Saab March 2025, Pentagon Replicator Aug 2025)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #3 (Energy):** Research uses static 1.5-2 hours; reality shows 10%/year incremental improvement + solid-state batteries 2027 (40-100% capacity increase)
  - **Fatal Contradiction #4 (Human Oversight):** Research assumes human-in-the-loop required; reality shows military pushing to human-on-the-loop (NORAD 2020, time-critical exemptions in DoD Directive 3000.09)
- **Core Problem:** Research foundation is **180-DEGREE OPPOSITE** of 2023-2024 reality (AI improves reliability, not degrades)
- **Alternative Considered:** Reconceptualize as "swarm logistics" (production, deployment tempo, replacement) NOT individual degradation
  - Timeline: 6-9 months (major redesign from scratch)
  - Prerequisites: Commission 2023-2025 military autonomy research review (20-40 hours)
  - Recommendation: **ONLY pursue if stakeholder insists AND resources available**
- **Final Disposition:** REJECT from current roadmap
- **Revisit Timeline:** 2028-2030 (3-5 years, if field stabilizes or new research commissioned)
- **Archived:** `/plans/completed/rejected/autonomous-weapons-rejection-rationale.md`
- **Lesson Learned:** Fast-moving fields (AI, military tech) require recent research (2023-2025), not 2018-2022. 2-4 year gap is FATAL when field changes faster than publication cycle.

**Net Impact on Roadmap:**
- **+12-16 hours:** Digital Consciousness Governance (new medium-priority feature)
- **-0 hours:** Performative Behavior (deferred, no current work—monitoring only ~4h/year)
- **-0 hours:** Autonomous Weapons (rejected, never allocated)
- **Total Phase 3 commitment:** 12-16 hours over 3-4 months

---

## Development Standards

**Every mechanic requires:**
1. Research Citations (2+ peer-reviewed sources, 2024-2025 preferred)
2. Parameter Justification (why this number? backed by data)
3. Mechanism Description (how it works, not just effects)
4. Interaction Map (what affects/is affected)
5. Expected Timeline (early/mid/late game)
6. Failure Modes (what can go wrong)
7. Test Validation (Monte Carlo evidence)

**Development Workflow:**
1. Research Phase → Create plan with citations
2. Design Phase → Define state, mechanics, interactions
3. Implementation Phase → Code, integrate, log, test
4. Validation Phase → Monte Carlo (N≥10)
5. Documentation Phase → Wiki, devlog, roadmap

**Balance Philosophy:** NO tuning for "fun" - this is a research tool. If model shows 90% extinction → DOCUMENT WHY. If 50% Utopia → DOCUMENT WHY.
