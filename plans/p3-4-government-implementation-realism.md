# P3.4: Government Implementation Realism

**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Enhancement - Governance Detail

## Overview

Add realistic government implementation failures, delays, and partial adoption rather than binary policy success/failure.

## Problem

Current simulation treats government policies as binary (deployed or not). Real government implementations:
- Take 2-10 years from legislation to full deployment
- Have 20-80% effectiveness (not 100%)
- Face institutional resistance and bureaucratic delays
- Depend on political will, funding, and expertise

## Proposed Solution

### Policy Implementation Lifecycle

```typescript
interface GovernmentPolicy {
  name: string;
  legislationPassed: boolean;
  implementationStartMonth: number;
  fullDeploymentMonth: number; // When fully effective
  currentEffectiveness: number; // 0-1, ramps up over time

  // Implementation factors
  fundingLevel: number; // 0-1, affects speed
  bureaucraticCapacity: number; // 0-1, affects effectiveness
  politicalWill: number; // 0-1, can decay over time
  publicSupport: number; // 0-1, affects funding/will

  // Failure modes
  capturedByIndustry: boolean;
  insufficientEnforcement: boolean;
  loopholes: boolean;
}

function updatePolicyImplementation(policy: GovernmentPolicy, state: GameState): void {
  if (!policy.legislationPassed) return;

  const monthsSinceStart = state.currentMonth - policy.implementationStartMonth;
  const expectedDeploymentTime = 36 / policy.fundingLevel; // 3 years base, longer if underfunded

  // Sigmoid ramp-up
  const deploymentProgress = monthsSinceStart / expectedDeploymentTime;
  policy.currentEffectiveness = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-5 * (deploymentProgress - 0.5)));

  // Effectiveness capped by bureaucratic capacity
  policy.currentEffectiveness *= policy.bureaucraticCapacity;

  // Political will can decay
  if (Math.random() < 0.01) { // 1% chance per month
    policy.politicalWill *= 0.95; // 5% decay
  }

  // Industry capture reduces effectiveness
  if (policy.capturedByIndustry) {
    policy.currentEffectiveness *= 0.4; // 60% reduction
  }
}
```

### Implementation Delay Factors

```typescript
interface GovernmentCapacity {
  regulatoryExpertise: number; // AI/tech expertise in government
  institutionalInertia: number; // Resistance to change
  politicalPolarization: number; // Consensus difficulty
  internationalCoordination: number; // For global policies
}
```

## Expected Impact

- More realistic policy effectiveness (30-70%, not 100%)
- Time delays reflect real-world implementation (2-10 years)
- Captures government failures (underfunding, capture, resistance)

## Test Criteria

- [ ] Policies take 24-60 months to reach full effectiveness
- [ ] Effectiveness varies 30-80% based on implementation quality
- [ ] Political will can decay over time (policy abandonment)
- [ ] Some policies are captured by industry (reduced effectiveness)
