## What the Research Validates About the Simulation

### Core Mechanisms (From `bionicSkills.ts`)

1. **Novice Bonus (60%) vs Expert Bonus (20%)** ✅
   - Directly supported by Peng et al. (2023) and Noy & Zhang (2023)
   - Less skilled workers benefit MORE from AI (absolute terms)

2. **Access Modifiers (Elite +30%, Precariat -30%)** ✅
   - Aligned with Microsoft (2024), OECD (2024), Brookings (2024)
   - Income, education, geography all predict access

3. **AI Literacy as Separate Factor** ✅
   - PMC (2024): Access alone insufficient—need literacy
   - Three-tier divide: Access, usage, outcomes

4. **Task Specificity** ✅
   - Nature Human Behaviour meta-analysis (2024): Context-dependent
   - Content creation (writing, code): AI helps
   - Complex decisions: AI doesn't consistently help
   - Model focuses on RIGHT domains

## What Needs Fixing (Critical Gaps)

### Priority 1: Phase Transition (CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** Model assumes permanent amplification
- **Reality:** Complementarity (Years 0-5) → Substitution (Years 5-10+)
- **Research:** Acemoglu & Restrepo (2022), 40+ years automation literature
- **Fix:** Add employment displacement effects as AI capability increases
- **Status:** Phase multiplier EXISTS in code but employment effects MISSING

### Priority 2: Performance vs Competence (CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** Model treats amplified performance as true skill gain
- **Reality:** Short-term performance ≠ long-term learning
- **Research:** Cognitive Research (2024): "Illusion of understanding"—students with AI scored 48-127% better initially but "scores plummeted" on retention tests
- **Fix:** Distinguish performance (with AI) from competence (without AI)
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Priority 3: Productivity-Wage Decoupling (HIGH)
- **Issue:** Model assumes productivity → wages (linear)
- **Reality:** Capital captures productivity gains without policy intervention
- **Research:** Brookings (2024), labor economics literature
- **Fix:** Add labor share parameter—productivity gains split between labor and capital
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Priority 4: Teaching Quality / Support (MEDIUM)
- **Issue:** Model treats AI access as uniform benefit
- **Reality:** AI + human guidance >> AI alone for skill retention
- **Research:** Frontiers Psychology (2024): "AI + Scaffolding group outperformed AI-only groups in both immediate post-test proficiency and longer-term retention"
- **Fix:** Add teaching quality modifier—elite get AI + support, precariat get AI only
- **Status:** PARTIALLY CAPTURED via `aiLiteracy`, needs explicit support parameter

## Key Studies (Most Important)

### Must-Read Peer-Reviewed Studies

1. **Noy & Zhang (2023) - Science**
   - "Experimental evidence on the productivity effects of generative artificial intelligence"
   - RCT, n=453, published in Science (top-3 journal)
   - Finding: 40% time reduction, 18% quality improvement, inequality DECREASED
   - Why it matters: Gold standard evidence for AI reducing skill gaps

2. **Peng et al. (2023) - Microsoft Research**
   - "The Impact of AI on Developer Productivity: Evidence from GitHub Copilot"
   - RCT, n=95, Microsoft + GitHub
   - Finding: 55.8% faster, novices benefit MORE
   - Why it matters: Direct validation of model's differential benefits mechanism

3. **Nature Human Behaviour Meta-Analysis (2024)**
   - "When combinations of humans and AI are useful"
   - Meta-analysis, 106 experiments, 370 effect sizes
   - Finding: Context-dependent—gains in content creation, losses in decision-making
   - Why it matters: Validates model's focus on programming/writing tasks

4. **Acemoglu & Restrepo (2022) - Econometrica**
   - "Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality"
   - Top-3 economics journal, 40 years of data
   - Finding: 50-70% of wage structure changes from automation displacing middle-skill workers
   - Why it matters: Warns against extrapolating short-term gains to long-term outcomes

5. **Cognitive Research (2024)**
   - "Does using artificial intelligence assistance accelerate skill decay?"
   - Experimental study with learning transfer tests

## Confidence Levels

### HIGH CONFIDENCE (use in simulation)
- AI amplification for programming, writing (TRL 9, multiple RCTs)
- Differential benefits by skill level (consistent across studies)
- Digital divide in AI access (extensive documentation)
- Phase transition complementarity → substitution (40+ years automation literature)

### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (use with caveats)
- Exact timeline of substitution (historically 5-10 years, AI may differ)
- Magnitude of deskilling effects (varies by task and support)
- Between-job inequality effects (historical pattern but AI unique)

### LOW CONFIDENCE (avoid in model)
- Which specific skills become obsolete (unpredictable)
- Whether new jobs emerge to absorb displaced workers (policy-dependent)
- Brain-computer interfaces (TRL 1-2, science fiction)

## What to Tell Stakeholders

### To Optimists
"Yes, AI is helping people. The research is real. GitHub Copilot makes novice programmers 55% faster. ChatGPT reduces writing time by 40% while improving quality. This is published in Science, not blog posts."

"BUT: These are short-term effects (2-3 years of data). History shows complementarity phases last 5-10 years before substitution begins. We need countermeasures—retraining, UBI, profit-sharing—or inequality will worsen."

### To Pessimists
"No, this isn't science fiction. We're not modeling brain chips. We're modeling tools people use RIGHT NOW—200M weekly ChatGPT users, 1M daily GitHub Copilot users."

"BUT: Your concerns are valid. Research shows AI can create 'illusions of understanding,' reduce on-the-job learning, and displace workers if capability exceeds task complexity. The model needs these mechanisms added."

### To Skeptics
"You're right that BCIs are science fiction (TRL 1-2). But the simulation doesn't model BCIs—it models AI tools."

"The code in `bionicSkills.ts` is based on Peng et al. (2023, Microsoft Research) and Noy & Zhang (2023, Science). These are rigorous RCTs published in top venues. The mechanism is sound."

"What needs fixing: Add phase transition, performance vs competence distinction, and capital capture mechanisms. With those, the model is defensible."

## Terminology Changes (Critical for Credibility)

### DON'T SAY (Science Fiction Framing)
- "Human-AI merger"
- "Brain-computer interfaces for enhancement"
- "Cyborg capabilities"
- "Neural augmentation"
- "Superhuman cognition"

### DO SAY (Realistic Framing)
- "AI-assisted cognition"
- "Intelligence augmentation"
- "Human-AI collaboration"
- "AI-mediated skill development"
- "Cognitive amplification via digital tools"

**Why it matters:** Using sci-fi language invites dismissal. Using HCI/cognitive science language connects to 60+ years of research on cognitive tools (calculators, search engines, now AI).

2. Compare model outputs to historical automation events (ATMs, Excel, self-checkout)
3. Validate against labor economics literature

### Month 3: Policy Levers
1. Add retraining effectiveness parameter
2. Add UBI / profit-sharing policy options
3. Add AI deployment regulation options
4. Test which interventions prevent inequality increase

## Final Verdict

**Is the simulation defensible?**

YES—with modifications.

**Current State:**
- Core mechanism (AI amplification with differential benefits): VALIDATED ✅
- Access inequality: VALIDATED ✅
- Task specificity: VALIDATED ✅
- TRL: 8-9 (fully deployed, peer-reviewed evidence) ✅

**Needs Addition:**
- Phase transition employment effects ⚠️
- Performance vs competence distinction ⚠️
- Capital capture mechanisms ⚠️
- Teaching quality modifiers ⚠️

**After Modifications:**
- Model will be grounded in peer-reviewed research
- Mechanisms will match observed reality
- Optimistic AND pessimistic pathways will be represented
- Policy sensitivity will be explicit

**The Path Forward:**

This is NOT about whether to model human-AI cognitive enhancement (that's happening NOW at massive scale). It's about modeling it CORRECTLY—with both the opportunities (research-backed amplification) and the risks (research-backed displacement, deskilling, capture).

The simulation can model cognitive enhancement pathways WITHOUT invoking science fiction—it just needs to stay grounded in digital tools, education, and access inequality (which it already does) while adding the countervailing mechanisms that research warns about (which it currently lacks).
