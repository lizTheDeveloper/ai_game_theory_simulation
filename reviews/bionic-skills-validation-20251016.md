## Contradictory Evidence & Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Skill-Complementarity Can Increase Inequality

**Source:** Acemoglu & Autor (2011), MIT Economics  
**Finding:** "Capital-skill complementarity: educated workers are strong complements to sophisticated new capital"  
**Mechanism:** When technology complements high skills, it can INCREASE inequality even if it boosts low-skill productivity  
**Implication:** AI might compress skill gaps WITHIN tasks but increase gaps BETWEEN job categories  
**DOI:** MIT Economics working papers

**How Model Addresses This:**
- ‚úÖ Access inequality (digital divide) captures the "complementarity for those who can use it" effect
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITATION:** Model doesn't distinguish between within-task and between-task inequality
- üìä **REFINEMENT NEEDED:** Add mechanism for job category shifts (low-skill jobs eliminated, new high-skill jobs created)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex Tasks May Reverse Novice Advantage

**Source:** Dell'Acqua et al. (2023b), Field Experimental Evidence  
**Finding:** "While novice workers typically show higher improvement, these effects may be reversed for complex tasks"  
**Mechanism:** For creative, ambiguous, or multi-stakeholder tasks, expert judgment still dominates  
**Implication:** Amplification factor should vary by task complexity  
**DOI:** 10.48550/arXiv.2307.10312

**How Model Addresses This:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITATION:** Model uses single amplification formula for all skills
- üìä **REFINEMENT:** Could add complexity modifier: Complex tasks (problem-solving, interpersonal) ‚Üí lower novice boost

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Adoption Patterns May Exclude Those Who'd Benefit Most

**Source:** Bick, Blandin & Deming (2024), Individual-Level Adoption Surveys  
**Finding:** "Generative AI adoption is higher among younger, more educated, and higher income people and lags in other populations"  
**Mechanism:** Self-selection in adoption means AI reaches those who need it LEAST  
**Implication:** Access barriers are understated in model  
**DOI:** NBER Working Paper 32487

**How Model Addresses This:**
- ‚úÖ Digital divide (access) partially captures this
- ‚úÖ AI literacy as separate skill captures "knowing how to use AI"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITATION:** Model doesn't capture self-selection / awareness barriers
- üìä **REFINEMENT:** AI literacy could grow slower for low-education segments (learning barrier)

---

## Recommended Parameter Refinements

### 1. Amplification Formula (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current:**
```typescript
noviceBonus = (1.0 - baselineSkill) √ó 0.60
expertBonus = baselineSkill √ó 0.20
```

**Recommendation:** Add task complexity modifier
```typescript
complexityFactor = skillDimension === 'problemSolving' || 'interpersonal' ? 0.7 : 1.0
noviceBonus = (1.0 - baselineSkill) √ó 0.60 √ó complexityFactor
expertBonus = baselineSkill √ó 0.20 √ó complexityFactor
```

**Rationale:** Dell'Acqua et al. (2023b) shows complex tasks reverse advantage

---

### 2. Access Gradient (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current:** Elite 90%, Middle 65%, Working 50%, Precariat 20%

**Recommendation:** Slightly lower across board to match adoption data
```
Elite: 85% (not 90% - even wealthy don't all adopt immediately)
Middle: 55% (not 65% - Bick et al. shows middle-income lag)
Working: 40% (not 50% - adoption lag is real)
Precariat: 15% (not 20% - infrastructure + awareness barriers)
```

**Rationale:** Bick, Blandin & Deming (2024) adoption surveys

---

### 3. AI Literacy Growth (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current:** AI literacy amplified like other skills

**Recommendation:** Add learning curve that's slower for low-education segments
```typescript
aiLiteracyGrowthRate = baseEducation === 'high' ? 0.02/month :
                       baseEducation === 'medium' ? 0.01/month :
                       0.005/month; // Precariat learns slowest
```

**Rationale:** PIAAC 2023 shows declining baseline literacy (harder to learn new tools)

---

### 4. Infrastructure as Explicit Barrier (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current:** Geography proxies for infrastructure

**Recommendation:** Add explicit infrastructure availability
```typescript
infrastructureQuality = country.isAdvancedEconomy ? 0.90 :
                        country.isMiddleIncome ? 0.60 :
                        0.30;
access *= infrastructureQuality;
```

**Rationale:** NCBI (2024) shows infrastructure gaps exist even in urban areas

---

## Simulation Validation Tests

To validate the bionic skills model, run these tests:

### Test 1: Skill Compression
**Expected:** Low-skill segments should show larger productivity gains than high-skill segments  
**Validation:** Compare productivity multiplier change (month 0 vs month 60) by segment  
**Pass Criteria:** Working class gain > Middle class gain > Elite gain

### Test 2: Access-Dependent Amplification
**Expected:** Rural segments with same baseline skills should gain LESS than urban segments  
**Validation:** Compare Rural Traditionalists (40% skills, 20% access) vs Working Class Skeptics (40% skills, 50% access)  
**Pass Criteria:** Working Class productivity > Rural productivity despite same baseline

### Test 3: Project Failure Reduction
**Expected:** As AI capability grows, economic productivity should increase (fewer project failures)  
**Validation:** Track productivity multiplier over time  
**Pass Criteria:** Multiplier increases from 1.0 (baseline) toward 1.4-1.7 (AI-amplified)

### Test 4: Inequality Dynamics
**Expected:** WITHIN-segment inequality should decrease, but access inequality might INCREASE overall gap  
**Validation:** Track elite-mass gap over time  
**Pass Criteria:** Gap should narrow if access equalizes, widen if access concentrates

---

## Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Core mechanisms validated by multiple high-quality sources
- ‚úÖ Captures tension between AI's leveling potential and access barriers
- ‚úÖ Skill distribution matches PIAAC 2023 US data closely
- ‚úÖ Project failure link to skills is empirically grounded
- ‚úÖ Amplification formula qualitatively matches observed effects

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't distinguish within-task vs between-task inequality (Acemoglu critique)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Single amplification formula doesn't account for task complexity variation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Access barriers may be understated (adoption self-selection)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't model skill trend (PIAAC shows skills DECLINING over time)

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT** with noted refinements. The model is scientifically sound and captures the key dynamics. The refinements are "nice to have" improvements, not critical flaws.

**Confidence:** 9/10 - This is one of the best-grounded mechanisms in the simulation.
