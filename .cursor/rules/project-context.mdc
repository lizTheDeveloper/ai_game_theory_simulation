This is a research simulation. We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can- let the model show what it shows.
cd /Users/annhoward/src/ai_game_theory_simulation && npx tsx scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts to run the monte carlo sim
Run sims in tmux so you can work on things in-between runs, which take awhile.
prefer to review logs over re-running the sim as it takes awhile to do
plans go in /plans and update them as you complete portions of it
session summaries go in /devlogs
update the docs in /docs/wiki when you add major features or change calculations
