Be as brief as possible, don't write excessive reviews after writing devlogs, only bring questions to the user.
This is a research simulation. We are never going for specific outcomes, only trying to figure out the most realistic, defensible model we can- let the model show what it shows.
cd /Users/annhoward/src/ai_game_theory_simulation && npx tsx scripts/monteCarloSimulation.ts to run the monte carlo sim
Always redirect stdout to a file in a logs folder with a timestamp and background the process. Use sleep to check it async as it appends logs to the file. Remember it takes time to run.
Run sims in tmux so you can work on things in-between runs, which take awhile.
prefer to review logs over re-running the sim as it takes awhile to do
plans go in /plans and update them as you complete portions of it
session summaries go in /devlogs
update the docs in /docs/wiki when you add major features or change calculations
